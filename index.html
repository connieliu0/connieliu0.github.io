          <h5>a piece about <em>vulnerabilities</em></h5>
        <p><em>Hot press paper/watercolor, 2018</em> In this piece, the girl’s inner thoughts are represented by flowers which are also behind the head of each statue along with a loosely transparent window. The statues give a seemingly perfect exterior but the windows have revealed a self that has its own vulnerabilities (represented by the flowers). The girl peeks over as she has realized the statues are no different from her. The statues are intentionally colored with hints of a flesh tint, showing the inner humanity that lies within.</p>

        <h3>Wallflower</h3>
          <h5>a piece about <em>hiding</em></h5>
        <p><em>Digital art, 2017</em> This piece was inspired by memories in elementary school of being too shy to talk to my classmates at recess. I was forever playing a game of hide and go seek without ever seeking, or taking initiative. My piece aims to show that if you stay still for too long, the vines will eventually start to cover you. You will slowly be forgotten in the passage of time. By never breaking free of the status quo, you will never be able to improve and grow as a person. Although the girl is at peace with that sentiment, I am not. This piece is a farewell to those days, as I am no longer counting and waiting. </p>

        <h3>Suburban Sprawl</h3>
          <h5>a piece about <em>identity</em></h5>
        <p><em>Cold press paper/watercolor/ink, 2018</em> I was inspired by the clashing of Eastern and Western cultures, an experience I’m familiar with as an “American Born Chinese”. Although the flowers are painted in the style of the East, when they’re viewed from afar, they blend in with the suburbs because they’re the same color scheme, showing how it’s possible to be different, yet connected. I wanted to have a contrast between order and chaos by free handing the central figure and yet using microns to provide stability to the piece. There’s a contrast between the natural forms (human and flowers) and the artificial forms (the buildings).</p>
