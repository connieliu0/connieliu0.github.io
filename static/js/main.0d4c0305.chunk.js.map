Me and my partner participated according to this <a href=\"https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cf8f4e73-3942-4298-8894-3d1effe75557#pageNum=1\">project brief</a> and ended up in <a href=\"https://assets.adobe.com/public/b7e508d5-10e4-4af1-7450-be3ced472a1d\">top 50 out of ~200 teams</a> (we were called Cornell Corns).</p>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/bf82c9a1-3633-495a-7c74-925d62caa59f-c9b3/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</strong></p>\n        <h4>The Problem</h4>\n        <h2 className=\"none\">How do we encourage seniors to participate in the gaming community, especially during a time of social distancing?</h2>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How do we make this app friendly and accessible to seniors?</li>\n          <li>How do we optimize the experience to recommend games that account for any problems that come with older age?</li>\n          <li>How do we take in account the social networks of seniors?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div className=\"forty\">\n        <h2>Our Solution</h2>\n        <p>We designed an app called <em>Arcade</em> which plays homage to the classic video game experiences many seniors have experienced when they were young.</p>\n        <p>In our app, seniors are able to join pre-created groups set by their family or nursing home to then set up times to play online games with each other through a Google Meet call. They’re also able to discover games that fit their liking based off of various filters that take in motor control, cognitive ability, genre, and more. We were inspired by online games in general because there are thousands that have been converted for online play that people don’t know about.</p>\n        <h2>User Research</h2>\n        <p>Because of the condensed time we weren’t able to interview anyone, so we got most of our information from the internet and my past experiences as a teacher at a senior living home.</p>\n        <h2>Major Considerations</h2>\n        <h3>Visually</h3>\n        <p>Our research revealed that elderly individuals may have difficulty seeing cool colors, so we used warm colors for our app’s visual design. Additionally, we purposely leaned toward larger icons and components, visual indicators that are not color-dependent, and a minimalist style to make interactions clear and accessible, to account for those with color-blindness or poor vision. Therefore for different buttons, we tried to incorporate different non-color reliant differences such as border style and thickness even though our palette was not color-blind friendly.</p>\n        <h3>Functionally</h3>\n        <p>Originally we planned to have a traditional social media platform where anyone on the internet could connect with each other. However our research revealed that <strong>seniors preferred to limit their circle to those they already have in-person and close interaction with</strong>. We saw this app to be a tool to connect seniors with their more immediate network (ie family), and therefore focused more on joining groups based off of a code provided by the family. </p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/onboarding.png\" alt=\"onboarding\"/>\n        <p>For onboarding we decided to focus on three major limiting factors for seniors - motor control, cognitive difficulty, and other physical problems they may have to recommend games that would best fit their needs. \n</p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/schedule.png\" alt=\"scheduling\"/>\n        <p>For scheduling and viewing invites, we made sure to have large clickable buttons which are also visually different through the border style. Event discovery is simple because we restricted it to pre-organized groups because seniors prefer to have interactions with a close intimate group.\n</p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/user_communityflow.png\" alt=\"user/comm\"/>\n        <p>For the user view we allowed them to bookmark games to play later and favorite games along with standard community joining functionalities. </p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/explore.png\" alt=\"explore\"/>\n        <p>For the explore page we continued with the same filtering process as onboarding. If you look at the style of each border for each filter, they correspond with the style of the button during the filtering selection.</p>\n        <h2>Results and Reflection</h2>\n        <p>We ended up scoring 77/100 which was pretty good for our first time ever participating in a design competition. I got a cumulative 12 hours of sleep that weekend, but I learned how to work with design systems on the go and with a partner remotely.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Looking back, we would’ve done more thinking to make the game to video integration process more seamless for non-technologically savvy users. Currently the flow would be to copy the game link and to paste it into the Google Meet chat, which definitely seems confusing. Also before prototyping, I would’ve definitely taken in spacing into consideration, as we were struggling to standardize it towards the end. To further improve the app, user-testing with seniors would definitely be needed as user-research relied entirely on prior experiences and online articles.\n        </p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Arcade;\n","import \"./App.css\";\nimport Bottom from \"./functions/Bottom.js\";\nimport Footer from \"./functions/Footer.js\";\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Zoom from \"./functions/Zoom.js\";\nimport Scrollspy from \"react-scrollspy\";\nimport { HashLink } from \"react-router-hash-link\";\n\nfunction Twitter(props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        {/* <hr /> */}\n        <ProjHead\n          title=\"Twitter Groups Feature Concept\"\n          description=\"Prototyping a feature concept to create more personalized and distinctive spaces on Twitter\"\n          image=\"twitter/header.png\"\n          timeline=\"Spring 2020, 8 weeks\"\n          role=\"Role\"\n          team=\"Sole Product Designer\"\n          tools=\"Figma\"\n          context=\"Intro Digital Product Design Course\"\n        />\n        <div className=\"sticky\">\n          <nav className=\"section-nav\">\n            <Scrollspy\n              items={[\n                \"solution\",\n                \"userresearch\",\n                \"problemstatement\",\n                \"brainstorming\",\n                \"prototyping\",\n                \"conclusion\",\n              ]}\n              currentClassName=\"is-current\"\n            >\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#solution\">Solution Overview</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#userresearch\">User Research</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#problemstatement\">Problem Statement</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#brainstorming\">Brainstorming</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#prototyping\">Prototyping</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</HashLink>\n              </li>\n            </Scrollspy>\n          </nav>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"projmargins\">\n          <h2>Overview</h2>\n          <p>\n            While Instagram and Facebook focus on connecting with friends, most\n            Twitter users have a mixed audience of friends, internet strangers,\n            and sometimes (especially in tech), professionals.

However because users edited one metric at a time,\n            the probability of an error to warrant an extra layer of protection\n            was low. Ultimately I went with option 4 - also because the\n            entrypoint was an edit button, the user would understand they were\n            launching into an edit state.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"Saving\">Saving</h3>\n          <p>\n            I was unsure whether to allow used to save on empty or when filled.\n            Only allowing save on filled blocks would set a guardrail to make\n            sure all blocks on the page were relevant to the user.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2028.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, saving on empty would allow for scaffolding as users\n            required back and forth interaction to settle on how they were\n            editing automations for testing purposes. Because there wasn't clear\n            value to ensuring only save on fill and it took more engineering\n            lift, we went with option 1.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"user-testing-feedback\">User Testing + Feedback</h3>\n          <p>\n            After 5 rounds of user testing, I found most tasks were completed.\n            The only struggle was that users would find the \"Add\" button but not\n            understand what it meant. Once users interacted with the dropdown\n            they were able to accomplish the task successfully. As a result, I\n            changed the language of the add entrypoint from &quot;Add&quot; to\n            &quot;Add Condition&quot;.

To ensure high\n            visibility, we integrated the graphs into the UI itself so users\n            wouldn&#39;t have to open up another tab.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Metrics</h3>\n          <p>\n            However, the difficulty with the Looker is that it was hard to tell\n            the numerical changes for each automation.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2010.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            After talking with engineers and presenting different statistical\n            options, I learned that the only feasible ones would be the{\" \"}\n            <strong>volume published</strong> (for publishing) and also the{\" \"}\n            <strong>number used out of total recommended</strong> (for\n            recommendations). I also decided that the &quot;percent\n            changes&quot;, although a valid indicator of a positive or negative\n            change - would need more testing to indicate whether or not an\n            actual investigable change had occurred or if it was just within the\n            flux of current events.\n          </p>\n          <h3>User Reactions from User Testing</h3>\n          <p>\n            When testing this feature -

This year I\n              proposed expanding the showcase to hold more projects and allow\n              for easier searching of projects that would pique the user's\n              interest.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Users who came to the p5.js showcase website were often{\" \"}\n              <strong>novices</strong>. This meant that they wanted a site that\n              would allow them to quickly see the possibilities of the type of\n              projects they'd be looking at as well as scan the technologies\n              used. Organization was especially important as my project grew the\n              showcase ten times.\n            </p>\n            <h2>UX Redesign</h2>\n            <p>\n              The current problem with the p5.js showcase (see image below) was\n              that it was unclear what each project composed of, as the user\n              would have to read each description to determine what it was.\n              Scanning was difficult because images were of different sizes and\n              text was located at different points. With my redesign, I focused\n              on standardizing UI for easy scannability and allowing the user to\n              filter through the projects, which is important especially if they\n              already know what kind of project they're looking for.\n            </p>\n            <Zoom src=\"p5/comparison.png\" img alt=\"comparing looks\" />\n            <h2>Implementing Changes through Development</h2>\n            <p>\n              Initially, I was going to integrate the showcase into the original\n              codebase of the p5.js website. However, after a month of auditing\n              and trying different solutions (and contacting many people in the\n              community to make sense of it), I came to the conclusion that for\n              what I wanted to do- which was autogenerating 50 projects and\n              having a filter for each, it would be very difficult to do it\n              within the current Handlebars framework. As a result, I planned a\n              new proposal to use a React Framework in which I would be able to\n              autogenerate different UI using content from the JSON files.\n            </p>\n            <h2>i18next Integration</h2>\n            <p>\n              Figuring out how to integrate i18next into the React framework was\n              one of the biggest challenges I faced. It took three days of\n              rereading the same docs over and over again, and I still could not\n              figure out how translations worked with nested JSON arrays. After\n              stumbling onto a GitHub thread from a couple of years ago I was\n              finally able to figure out the syntax.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Because of the problems I had with figuring out the previous tech\n              stack of the website and with creating the new one, as part of my\n              project I wrote up brief{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://github.com/connieliu0/p5.js-showcase/blob/master/showcase2020_documentation.md\">\n                documentation\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              about how i18next worked with the JSON files.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Designing the Data Visualizations</h2>\n            <p>\n              Another challenge was figuring out what data visualizations I\n              wanted in the beginning. In my original iteration, I focused on\n              splitting it up into three different categories. However, that\n              ruined the linear narrative flow and all the different\n              visualizations felt very separate from one another. At one point,\n              I just had a series of graphs that were auto-generated by the\n              Google Form. I also had planned to use d3.js but my mentors\n              encouraged me to change my approach to different JS libraries that\n              were more tailored towards the graph types I was planning for.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/data1.png\" img alt=\"dataviz\" />\n            <p>\n              The one advice my mentor told me that really stuck with me was to\n              design the visualizations for a story. In my final iteration, I\n              made sure that the visualizations acted as part of a narrative,\n              and incorporated it with a sentence that explained the\n              significance of the visuals.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/data2.png\" img alt=\"dataviz2\" />\n            <h2>Designing the Gallery</h2>\n            <p>\n              In my initial iteration of the gallery I initially thought about\n              separating the works by topic as seen below.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/galleryold.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <p>\n              However I soon realized that it was better to show the users\n              upfront what they could filter through. Because there were so many\n              different works in the end- the filter worked much better than a\n              static page. Below is the final gallery.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/gallerynew.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <h2>Organizing the Submissions</h2>\n            <p>\n              Another thing that changed this year was that I reached out to\n              many different institutions and people to try and increase the\n              number of submissions. As a result, the showcase grew to 60\n              submissions! In order to make it easier for people to find what\n              they were interested in among all the submissions, I split them up\n              into 11 different categories. I also put tags on the bottom of\n              each entry to give more context to the technologies used.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In order to get more people to submit and also check out the\n              showcase, I created some marketing graphics. It was a challenge\n              for me, as someone who hadn’t created graphic designs in a while,\n              but it was worth it and I learned a lot.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/market.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <h2>Final Product</h2>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Added translation support and implemented translations for\n                Spanish and Chinese\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Implemented data visualizations with Leaflet.js, p5.js, and\n                Chart.js\n              </li>\n              <li>Added filters for various project categories</li>\n              <li>\n                Added tool tags for various niche libraries and functions used\n                in p5.js\n              </li>\n              <li>Created documentation for translation contributions</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h2>Future</h2>\n            <p>\n              Currently, I am the maintainer of the p5.js 2020 showcase repo and\n              it exists within my GitHub account.
