It takes first hand accounts of life from users after natural disasters and analyzes them for negative sentiment which it presents as a percentage. <strong>A functional version of the app can be seen <a href= \"https://bigredhacks40677.appspot.com\">here</a></strong></p>\n        <h4>Researching the Problem</h4>\n        <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>\n        <p>Under the umbrella theme of <strong>natural disasters</strong>, we decided to focus on the long term mental health of a community after a natural disaster. Oftentimes, apps and relief efforts are focused on the immediate impact and there is little information on the community years after.</p>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How do we look over multiple communities years after a disaster?</li>\n          <li>How do we make sure implementation efforts are successful?</li>\n          <li>How do we understand numerous individual feedback messages?</li>\n          <li>How do we accomodate the needs of both <strong>users</strong>, the government and survivors?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h4>My Role</h4>\n        <h2>Illustrating and Designing</h2>\n        <p>During our process I was tasked with developing a friendly user interface and color scheme to make our user (survivors) feel at ease with 1) contributing stories and bringing up past trauma and 2) understanding the stories of others.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux1.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n          <img src=\"aux2.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n        <p>I created a mascot, a koala in a construction hat to give off a vibe of optimism and rebuilding. The color scheme of light browns and mint greens represent a natural color scheme with the green representing rejuvenation. Besides wireframing and illustration I also worked with the team on brainstorming the idea and assisted with HTML/CSS.</p>\n        <h2 className=\"forty\">Final Product</h2>\n        <p>Ultimately we decided on using sentiment analysis to characterize large sets of written personal accounts for various different natural disasters. In our final product, the first page focused on explaining the product. Then the official first page is focused on user (survivors) input, because the primary objective is to collect data for sentiment analysis. Because the survivor’s well-being is a focus as well we included access to mental health and support sources. The next page in the flow is the overall sentiment analysis so there is transparency about the purpose of collecting the responses. The sentiment analysis page is mostly for governmental organizations to see.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux3.1.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        <p>We have also added a page about what others have said so the survivor can feel a sense of solidarity (the stock responses are not authentic responses and just to test to see if the sentiment analysis worked). An about page was added for context about the project.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux3.2.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        <h2 className=\"forty\">Reflection</h2>\n        <p>If we had more time our team would focus on creating a long-term analytics portion of the website. That way the charity or governmental organization could have a comprehensive view to see if their efforts have paid off or not truly in the long-term rather than a single point in time.</p>\n        <p>A general note on the <strong>users</strong> of the product, since it includes both survivors and governmental organizations/charities, we designed with considerations of both in mind. We were particularly wary about the mental health of the survivors and in future iterations of the product would communicate with real users (survivors) to see if we handled collecting information deliberately enough.</p>\n        <p>Overall, it was my first time ever-making a web app with a team (shoutout to my teammates they were absolutely amazing) and I learned a lot on the way beyond making our product from IBM Watson to the Agile framework. More importantly, turns out you can get enough sleep at a Hackathon and make a product at the same time!</p>\n          <img src=\"hackathon.jpg\" img alt=\"the team\"/>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Auxilio;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './functions/Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player';\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction UXCase(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n      <ProjHead\n        title=\"Instagram Stories Redesign\"\n        details=\"UX Mini Case Study | December 2019-January 2020 | Figma\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"instatop.png\" img alt=\"instagram cover pic\"/>\n      </div>\n        <h2>Problem</h2>\n        <p>Instagram Stories is a new feature shipped in 2018 similar to Snapchat stories.

How do we make it easier for users to choose what kind of accounts they want to see given Instagram’s large and diverse user base.</p>\n      <h2>Target Audience</h2>\n        <p>I utilized user interviews with frequent Instagrammers (high schoolers to college students) about: </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How often they used stories</li>\n          <li>Why they used it as much as they did</li>\n          <li>What would incentivize them to use it more</li>\n          <li>Differences to snapchat stories</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In addition to in person interviews, I made a form to gather more data from different groups of users. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYBAo1ZWGLeSHhnl50lnWReJhn8CCACgwpxTFe9AssA/edit?usp=sharing\">Click here to view results and analysis from that form!</a></p>\n      <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>In order to organize my key findings, I used an affinity diagram to sort the information from user interviews.</p>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igfindings.png\" img alt=\"compiled findings\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Personas</h2>\n     <div className=\"center\">\n       <img src=\"igpersonas.png\" img alt=\"user profiles\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Narrowing the Problem</h2>\n    <p>Based off of my key findings and the needs of my personas I decided on a new problem statement.</p>\n    <p>People want to use stories about people they care about but they can’t because:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Instagram’s algorithm is based off of what they click on the most</li>\n      <li>Other accounts get buried as a result</li>\n      <li>Users don’t have time to scroll through all their stories</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Through my research, users indicated that they cared most about <strong>their close friends</strong> and having more <strong>ease</strong> in navigating what stories were available for viewing.</p>\n    <p>After brainstorming, I decided on the solution space which was separating stories based off of <strong>account types</strong>. Examples of these types would be: \"personal, business, art, writing, music\". Additionally Instagram's close friends functionality would serve as another account type.</p>\n    <p>In fact Instagram already has a functionality for this, by asking businesses to fit themselves under categories as seen by the screenshot below.</p>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igcategories.png\" img alt=\"igcategories\"/>\n   </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>I created three low to mid fidelity mock ups of the solution space.</p>\n    <h2>Idea 1: List Mode</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"1.jpg\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Pros</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Allows user to see all different account types at once</li>\n        <li>Medium feasibility- have to construct different screens</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Cons</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have to tap multiple times to get to see the list of all the stories</li>\n        <li>Medium-low impact- does not take into account what the user wants to see the most</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid1.png\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 2: Expand and Collapse</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"2.jpg\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Automatically opens to close friend’s stories, the ones the user will care about most</li>\n          <li>Allows for exploration of other type of accounts at the same time</li>\n          <li>High impact and high feasibility</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can’t see all different kinds of accounts at once</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid2.png\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 3: Tap and Drag</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"3.jpg\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can see all different account types at once</li>\n          <li>Simple drag down to view all stories at once, or one account type at a time</li>\n          <li>Medium impact- lets user explore easily</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Still can’t see stories immediately after opening the app, have to click or drag to get to stories</li>\n          <li>Medium-low feasibility- markably different from the current Instagram stories layout</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid3.png\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Exploring Expand n Collapse</h2>\n    <p>I chose this option because it allows:</p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Users to preview stories automatically from the beginning.

All other work from color scheme, vector graphics, layout, and content writing is mine. The prompt I was given was to create a flyer for the product, which was still in its beginning stages. In order to write the content I interviewed various interns and the CEO on the various benefits of the product. This led to the change in content on the last iteration as the final feature of building safety was no longer considered a selling point for the product.</p>\n      <p>As for web design work I created high fidelity mockups for the job application and job search pages. I coded the individual job description pages (example <a href = \"https://getinstahub.com/businessDev\">here</a>) and made sure they worked with responsive resizing.</p>\n      <img src=\"instahub.png\" img alt =\"instahub design examples\"/>\n      <h2 className=\"forty\">Role for FBLA/Rhapsody</h2>\n      <a href = \"https://issuu.com/udhsrhapsody/docs/rhapsody_magazine_2019_final\">2019 Version (NCTE REALM First Class Award)</a> | <a href = \"https://issuu.com/udhsrhapsody/docs/rhapsody_magazine_2018_final\">2018 Version (NCTE REALM Superior Award)</a>\n      <p>For the literary arts magazine I was the art editor in 2018 and editor in chief (or senior editor) in 2019.

The ad was done entirely myself with her feedback as well as the opening page for the Virtual Business Challenge article. The design process started off with determining the theme (modern) and taking inspiration from notable business magazines such as TIME magazine.

During high school I did various forms of <a href=\"https://conliuart.wixsite.com/portfolio/art-as-service\">environmental activism</a> with the local borough but this time I wanted to use my skills for a professional nonprofit organization.</p>\n      <h2 className=\"forty\">Process</h2>\n       <p>At the beginning of the project I first went to the PennEnvironment office to discuss what content they wanted in the infographic. I was provided with a couple documents that contained an overview of the Bill and I organized the most important/relevant information into a document. Then, I drafted what the infographic would look like through a sketch. I then sent that to the outreach director and received feedback on the design and content. I also drafted the colors in a low fidelity mockup. Below is the first iteration:</p>\n         <img src=\"penn1.png\" img alt=\"design sketches\"/>\n         <img src=\"penn2.png\" img alt=\"color mockup\"/>\n      <p>Based off of the feedback, I was given two major suggestions- one to include more PennEnvironment colors (add blues), to change certain informational parts and to improve on categorizing information by providing clear distinguishable markers in content through color and shapes. Below is the final iteration:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <ImageGallery items={design} />\n     </div>\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <h2>Reflection</h2>\n      <p>Future Directions</p>\n       <ul>\n       <li><strong>Increase accessibility:</strong> I would experiment more with using distinct shapes and rely less on color. Currently there are some features to improve accessibility, for one the header of each section is left aligned and the same font/size so the reader knows where to expect each part. Also, if I could revamp this infographic, I would definitely add bolded text to large blocks of text (since the flyer is very word heavy).</li>\n       <li><strong>Compartmentalize information even further:</strong> For the Purpose section I would split the purposes into the topics that talk about reducing and eliminating and topics that talk about building and growing and add subheadings.</li>\n       </ul>\n      <p>For my second formal attempt with Adobe Illustrator I'd say I learned a lot and putting together informational graphics is easier said than done! Overall it was extremely gratifying to know that my flyer has been helpful in educating people about Pennsylvania's renewable energy efforts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Visual;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './functions/Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Bottom from './functions/Bottom.js';\n\nfunction Habitat(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ProjHead\n            title=\"Habitat for Humanity\"\n            description=\"streamlining volunteer signups through a volunteer portal\"\n            image=\"habitat/habitat.png\"\n            timeline=\"Spring 2020, 6 weeks with Cornell Hack4Impact\"\n            role=\"With\"\n            team=\"2 Project Managers, 4 Engineers\"\n            tools=\"Figma, HTMl/CSS\"\n          />\n   <div className=\"projmargins\">\n        <div className=\"forty\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n        <p>Habitat for Humanity Tompkins County is a non-profit group in the Ithaca Area that builds homes for those in need. As part of Cornell's Hack4Impact chapter I was in charge of scoping out the details and designing a volunteer portal to streamline the process. At this point in time I was the club's <em>sole designer</em>.\n        </p>\n        <h2>The Problem</h2>\n        <p>Currently the Habitat for Humanity Tompkins County chapter streamlines the volunteer sign up process through email and an excel document which can lead to many errors. We were tasked to create a portal for volunteers to sign up for shifts and to upload forms to help make the process easier and reduce the amount of work needed by the one volunteer administrator.</p>\n        <h2>Process</h2>\n        <p>I started off with determining product specs through a call with the client. Based off the first call I made a series of low-fi sketches.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/lofis.png\" img alt=\"lofis\"/>\n        <p>The low fidelities revealed many product specs that we needed to sort out with the client, such as the need for \"groups\" of volunteers. We recompiled a list of questions to ask at the next meeting. Then, based off of that I began to do a medium fidelity prototype</p>\n        <p>Due to time constraints, the medium-fidelity immediately turned into the high-fidelity as front-end needed to get started within the given time constraint. Because of the expedited timeline, we ended up having to accomodate for new needs on the fly such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Integrating a general information notice sent out to volunteers onto the website</li>\n          <li>Adding log in, log out, and change password flows</li>\n          <li>Filtering and searching for events on the volunteer side</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Please contact me if you'd like to learn more about various decisions we made!</p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <p>We're currently still working on implementing the live version! However below are the wireframes I created for the product.</p>\n        <h2>Admin Flow</h2>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/nIF9eGrTjsXGsi335IxRLZ/Habitat-for-Humanity-Figma?node-id=760%3A2&viewport=460%2C367%2C0.08831579238176346&scaling=scale-down-width/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong> or follow along below.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/admin3.png\" img alt=\"admin3views\"/>\n        <p>In the admin flow, we have current volunteer assignments sorted by day because there can be multiple assignments in a day. Then for adding events we made sure to have repeat weeks as many assignments are on a weekly basis. Finally we have account information for password and contact management. Although not pictured, this tab will also be for <strong>volunteers</strong> in the final project.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/adminform.png\" img alt=\"admin form view\"/>\n        <p>Because the main purpose of the liability form tracker is to know which groups haven’t completed their forms yet, we included a way to hide completed groups in the second iteration. We also allowed a way for administrators to upload forms as we learned that often volunteers will hand in their forms in person on the actual day of the event.</p>\n        <h2>Volunteer Flow</h2>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/8AgoqtIhrZosB3RQ3u4Zvd/Habitat-for-Humanity-Volunteer-Flow?node-id=1%3A244&viewport=458%2C366%2C0.06753058731555939&scaling=scale-down-width/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong> or follow along below</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/volunteershifts.png\" alt=\"shifts\"/>\n        <p>The first page of the volunteer flow is upcoming shifts, because that way they have a constant reminder of what is coming up. We also have a calendar view so they can see what they have coming up long-term. We strayed away from a daily or weekly calendar because most volunteers for Habitat for Humanity only had unique monthly appointments. For the visual design of the different blocks in the calendar, we made sure we stuck with our color system and did not rely solely on color to improve accessibility.</p>\n        <p>In our color system, a blue with white inside block meant pending assignments, crossed out text meant it was canceled, and green filled in block meant the volunteer confirmed and was going.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/volunteersignup.png\" alt=\"signup\"/>\n      <p>We continued this color system into signup. As you can see the green outline box was in the confirmed for upcoming shifts and the button when the user confirms. The blue outline box is there for upcoming shifts you can sign up for. </p>\n      <p>We added filtering later because volunteers would often plan for shifts months in advance, and those wouldn’t immediately show up in the beginning.</p>\n      <p>Although not detailed, we had to figure out how the group system and if individuals in the group would have to make individual accounts or be incorporated into our database. Because many of these group members would be one-time only (for example clubs and fraternities), we decided that only the group leader needed to make the account.</p>\n      <img src=\"habitat/volunteerform.png\" alt=\"volunteer form\"/>\n      <p>For the form we have two versions, individual and group to account for the two different use cases.</p>\n        <h2>Reflection</h2>\n        <p>It was my first time working on a large team and also with a client! Because Hack4Impact Cornell is still a young and growing club on campus, I took a cross-discplinary role and even held a workshop for front-end on best HTML and CSS practices. Moving to remote teamwork halfway through the semester became a challenge, but I realized a huge part of success is overcommunication and always checking in with your teammates. </p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/image.png\" img alt=\"habitat pic\"/>\n        <h2>Future</h2>\n        <p>Because a major hurdle was not having design integrated into the timeline, I was unable to spend as much time on user research, prototyping, and usability testing as I would have liked. I was unable to support decisions off of user research, and much of the design thinking was lost due to time constraints.</p>\n        <p>Currently I'm serving as <strong>National Director of Design</strong> for the overarching Hack4Impact organization to remedy this problem. For Summer 2020 I've been reaching out to various chapters to learn more about their design practices to consolidate an official timeline for teams to follow as well as compiling resources. Please <strong>contact me</strong> to see a preview of what I've been working on as the official national website is still in-progress.</p>\n        <h2>Bonus</h2>\n        <p>I also do marketing for Hack4Impact, and recently did a revamp of the brand.

They’re also able to discover games that fit their liking based off of various filters that take in motor control, cognitive ability, genre, and more. We were inspired by online games in general because there are thousands that have been converted for online play that people don’t know about.</p>\n        <h2>User Research</h2>\n        <p>Because of the condensed time we weren’t able to interview anyone, so we got most of our information from the internet and my past experiences as a teacher at a senior living home.</p>\n        <h2>Major Considerations</h2>\n        <h3>Visually</h3>\n        <p>Our research revealed that elderly individuals may have difficulty seeing cool colors, so we used warm colors for our app’s visual design. Additionally, we purposely leaned toward larger icons and components, visual indicators that are not color-dependent, and a minimalist style to make interactions clear and accessible, to account for those with color-blindness or poor vision. Therefore for different buttons, we tried to incorporate different non-color reliant differences such as border style and thickness even though our palette was not color-blind friendly.</p>\n        <h3>Functionally</h3>\n        <p>Originally we planned to have a traditional social media platform where anyone on the internet could connect with each other. However our research revealed that <strong>seniors preferred to limit their circle to those they already have in-person and close interaction with</strong>. We saw this app to be a tool to connect seniors with their more immediate network (ie family), and therefore focused more on joining groups based off of a code provided by the family. </p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <img src=\"arcade/onboarding.png\" alt=\"onboarding\"/>\n        <p>For onboarding we decided to focus on three major limiting factors for seniors - motor control, cognitive difficulty, and other physical problems they may have to recommend games that would best fit their needs. \n</p>\n        <img src=\"arcade/schedule.png\" alt=\"scheduling\"/>\n        <p>For scheduling and viewing invites, we made sure to have large clickable buttons which are also visually different through the border style. Event discovery is simple because we restricted it to pre-organized groups because seniors prefer to have interactions with a close intimate group.\n</p>\n        <img src=\"arcade/user_communityflow.png\" alt=\"user/comm\"/>\n        <p>For the user view we allowed them to bookmark games to play later and favorite games along with standard community joining functionalities. </p>\n        <img src=\"arcade/explore.png\" alt=\"explore\"/>\n        <p>For the explore page we continued with the same filtering process as onboarding. If you look at the style of each border for each filter, they correspond with the style of the button during the filtering selection.</p>\n        <h2>Results and Reflection</h2>\n        <p>We ended up scoring 77/100 which was pretty good for our first time ever participating in a design competition. I got a cumulative 12 hours of sleep that weekend, but I learned how to work with design systems on the go and with a partner remotely.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Looking back, we would’ve done more thinking to make the game to video integration process more seamless for non-technologically savvy users. Currently the flow would be to copy the game link and to paste it into the Google Meet chat, which definitely seems confusing. Also before prototyping, I would’ve definitely taken in spacing into consideration, as we were struggling to standardize it towards the end. To further improve the app, user-testing with seniors would definitely be needed as user-research relied entirely on prior experiences and online articles.\n        </p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <Bottom\n      nextproject=\"\"\n      next=\"\"\n      />\n        </div>\n\n        <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Arcade;\n","import \"./App.css\";\nimport Bottom from \"./functions/Bottom.js\";\nimport Footer from \"./functions/Footer.js\";\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Zoom from './functions/Zoom.js'\n\n\nfunction Twitter(props) {\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        {/* <hr /> */}\n        <ProjHead\n          title=\"Twitter Groups Feature Concept\"\n          image=\"twitter/header.png\"\n          timeline=\"Spring 2020, 8 weeks\"\n          role=\"Role\"\n          team=\"Sole Product Designer\"\n          tools=\"Figma\"\n        />\n        <div className=\"projmargins\">\n          <h2>Overview</h2>\n          <p>\n            While Instagram and Facebook focus on connecting with friends, most\n            Twitter users have a mixed audience of friends, internet strangers,\n            and sometimes (especially in tech), professionals.

In many fandoms,\n            there are “group chats” where users can meet others with the same\n            interests in a private space.\n          </p>\n          <img src=\"twitter/twitterex.png\" alt=\"twitter examples\" />\n          <p>\n            My user research found that these group chats could get awkward and\n            dissolved quickly - a product solution was needed.\n          </p>\n          <h2>The Problem Statement</h2>\n          <p>\n            When people use Twitter, they find it difficult to be able to tweet\n            what they want because:\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"three\">\n            <p>\n              <span>🙅‍♀️</span>\n              <br /> All their tweets/replies are public and they don’t want\n              their entire audience to see them\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <span>👥</span>\n              <br /> They have niche interests where their tweets would only\n              apply to a certain group of people\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <span>👔</span> <br />\n              They don’t want to sound unprofessional or uninformed\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <h3>Understanding Contexts</h3>\n          <p>\n            Because of Twitter's sprawling user base, I made different use cases\n            of the problem statement, showing how different people encounter the same problem.\n          </p>\n          <img src=\"twitter/usecase.png\" alt=\"usecases\" />\n          <h4>Brainstorming</h4>\n          <h2 className=\"none\">How Did I Get There?</h2>\n          <p>After brainstorming I landed on three solutions:</p>\n          <h3>Twitter Shower Thoughts</h3>\n          <img src=\"twitter/sketch2.jpeg\" alt=\"sketch1\" />\n          <p>\n            ✓ Would allow users to post whatever they wanted to a select number\n            of people, almost like a private Twitter integrated into a public\n            one.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            ✗ Would only allow one on one conversations and prevent discussion.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Twitter Private Conversations</h3>\n          <img src=\"twitter/sketch1.jpeg\" alt=\"sketch2\" />\n          <p>✓ Would allow replies to be only seen to the poster</p>\n          <p>\n            ✗ Lacked any feasibility for community engagement. After all, we\n            tweet because we want to be <strong>heard</strong>.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Twitter Groups</h3>\n          <img src=\"twitter/sketch3.png\" alt=\"sketch2\" />\n          <p>\n            ✓ Would allow users to post whatever they wanted, but also provided\n            the perfect degree of customizability as to who would see the post.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            ✓ The user could use groups to rant to their close friends but also\n            post the latest fandom news with fellow internet users at the same\n            time.\n          </p>\n         \n          <h4>Prototyping</h4>\n          <h2 className=\"none\">Figuring Out Where the Pieces Fit</h2>\n          <h3>Entry-points</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/entrypoint.png\" alt=\"entrypoints\" />\n          <p>\n            Ultimately I decided on option D because user research indicated\n            that users were less inclined to use features that were hidden in\n            the sidebar (such as Lists). Also, options B and C were ruled out\n            because that was how Twitter currently integrated Lists and Special\n            News Features into the feed.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Browsing Groups and Group Details</h4>\n          <h2 className=\"none\">How do we view groups?</h2>\n          <h3>Groups Central Page</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/viewgroups.png\" alt=\"viewgroups\" />\n          <p>\n            I ultimately settled on option D. User feedback indicated that it\n            was important to <strong>quickly</strong> and{\" \"}\n            <strong>easily</strong> navigate between each group’s content. They\n            didn’t want another cluttered feed like the home page.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This posed another problem, how do we still ensure the user can view\n            all the content in a single stream? Users indicated they still\n            wanted an option to see an <strong>unfiltered view.</strong>\n          </p>\n          <h3>Integrating an Unfiltered View</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/unfilteredview.png\" alt=\"unfilitered\" />\n          <p>\n            Although option A was similar to how Twitter integrated Lists onto\n            the homepage, I went with option B in the end because the\n            interaction was more seamless while swiping would provide a break in\n            the interaction.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Also, since the default Twitter feed is organized by highlights, the\n            user would implicitly understand that the Twitter groups feed is\n            organized the same way.\n          </p>\n          <h3>What makes these groups so different anyways?</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/groupsdifferent.png\" alt=\"groups different\" />\n          <p>\n            User testing showed that leaving the presentation of groups to be\n            the same as a user profile proved to be very confusing, ruling out\n            option A. Option C would make viewing the follower count difficult\n            if the cover photo was a detailed photo.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In the end, I chose option B, however there was still a major\n            problem-{\" \"}\n            <strong>\n              users didn’t know the difference between following and joining at\n              first glance.\n            </strong>\n          </p>\n          <h3>What’s the difference between joining and following?</h3>\n          <p>\n            The point of joining and following was to allow people the option of\n            passively following a group and to also allow for more control over\n            posting privileges. Only people who joined a group would be allowed\n            to post and follow at the same time. This would allow more\n            customization in the usage of groups.\n          </p>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/joinvsfollow.png\" alt=\"join versus follow\" />\n          <p>\n            To explain the difference I took inspiration from how Twitter\n            currently explains its features, through a bottom pop-up modal.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Final Interaction for Browsing</h3>\n          <div class=\"special\">\n            <img src=\"twitter/browsegif.gif\" alt=\"browsing groups\" />\n          </div>\n          <h4>Searching Groups</h4>\n          <h2 className=\"none\">How do we find these groups?</h2>\n          <h3>Iteration 1: Integrating Your Groups, Explore, and Create</h3>\n          <img src=\"twitter/integration.png\" alt=\"integration\" />\n          <p>\n            Initially I had the idea of having{\" \"}\n            <em>Your Groups, Explore and Create</em> all be accessed through the\n            same tab system, indicating they had equal importance. However,\n            through user research I learned that:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Users will only use <em>Explore</em> on Twitter once or twice in\n              the beginning when setting up the groups they wanted to follow.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Users would use <em>Create</em> once, twice, or even never,\n              meaning it didn’t need to be as accessible as viewing the feed.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Iteration 2: Integrating Explore and Search</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/iteration2.png\" alt=\"iteration2\" />\n          <p>\n            For a while, I was stuck on trying to integrate both searching{\" \"}\n            <strong>for all groups on Twitter</strong> (Explore) and searching{\" \"}\n            <strong>within your own groups</strong> (Search). After user\n            research, I learned that my explorations in my second iteration\n            weren’t enough because:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              The difference in function between <em>Your Groups, Search,</em>{\" \"}\n              and <em>Explore</em> was <strong>confusing</strong> from first\n              glance\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              If users really wanted to look for groups <strong>ALL</strong>{\" \"}\n              over Twitter, they always went to the bottom bar when prompted\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Users wanted a way to access{\" \"}\n              <strong>a list of groups they were currently in</strong> instead\n              of solely relying on the carousel\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Iteration 3: The Final Solution</h3>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/iteration3final.png\" alt=\"iteration3\" />\n          <p>\n            For my final solution I simplified <em>exploring</em> and{\" \"}\n            <em>searching</em> into one action.\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Because users would only have one or two groups under a keyword,\n              it allowed space for an option to explore groups from the search\n              button on the bottom\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              The empty state would make room for a list of all groups a user\n              was in, which made sense because that was when a user would want\n              to access a specific group anyways\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Final Interaction for Searching</h3>\n          <div class=\"special\">\n            <img src=\"twitter/searchgif.gif\" alt=\"searching groups\" />\n          </div>\n          <h4>Creating Groups</h4>\n          <h2 className=\"none\">Forming the Flocks… I Mean Groups</h2>\n          <p>\n            Although the content requirements for this feature were\n            straight-forward, I went through several iterations to make it match\n            Twitter’s design system and increase usability.\n          </p>\n          <Zoom src=\"twitter/createprocess.png\" alt=\"create process\" />\n          <p>\n            In my original version, it was difficult for the user to know where\n            to click to input their information.

Recently, I started tweeting\n            more and I realized that I had professionals following me and\n            underclassmen from high school and close friends. I didn’t know what\n            to post and so I didn’t post at all.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Ultimately, if there were more time I would look into how users\n            interact with others within groups. Besides retweets and posts, what\n            else would make Twitter Groups different from any old group chat or\n            shared account? Would it be possible to integrate discussion boards,\n            polls, or collaborations?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In addition, since this project was created before Twitter Fleets, I\n            wasn't able to foresee that the group icons would look similar to\n            Fleet icons. If I could go back, I would change the UI to be more\n            distinctive.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In the end, Twitter Groups is a solution that at the very least\n            makes <strong>Twitter a comfortable space for everyone.</strong>\n          </p>\n          <h3>\n            Read the case study on Medium{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/finding-your-own-nests-a-twitter-case-study-970d2aa4efd8\">\n              here\n            </a>\n            !\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n        <Bottom nextproject=\"abillionveg Communities\" next=\"/abillion\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default Twitter;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './functions/Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Bottom from './functions/Bottom.js';\n\nfunction GSoC(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        {/* <hr/> */}\n        <ProjHead\n            title=\"p5.js 2020 Showcase - a Space for the Creative Computing Community\"\n            image=\"p5/showcase.gif\"\n            timeline=\"June-Aug 2020\"\n            role=\"Role\"\n            team=\"Designer and Developer\"\n            tools=\"Figma, React.js, Data Viz JS Libraries\"\n          />\n  <div className=\"projmargins\">\n        <p><strong>View the live site <a href=\"https://showcase.p5js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and read the Medium article <a href=\"https://medium.com/processing-foundation/increasing-the-organization-and-scope-of-the-p5-js-showcase-7193ef558c5a\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> </strong> Currently has been visited by 16k users and has 68k page views.</p>\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n        <div className=\"forty\">\n        <p>\n        The p5.js showcase was established last year by a previous GSoC student and consisted of six projects (view <a href=\"https://p5js.org/showcase/\">here</a>). This year I proposed expanding the showcase to hold more projects and allow for easier searching of projects that would pique the user's interest.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <h2>UI Problem</h2>\n        <p>\n        The current problem with the p5.js showcase (see image below) was that it was unclear what each project composed of, as the user would have to read each description to determine what it was. Scanning was difficult because images were of different sizes and text was located at different points. With my redesign, I focused on standardizing UI for easy scannability and allowing the user to filter through the projects, which is important especially if they already know what kind of project they're looking for.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"p5/old.png\" img alt=\"old look\"/>\n        <h2>Development Problem</h2>\n        <p>\n        Initially, I was going to integrate the showcase into the original codebase of the p5.js website. However, after a month of auditing and trying different solutions (and contacting many people in the community to make sense of it), I came to the conclusion that for what I wanted to do- which was autogenerating 50 projects and having a filter for each, it would be very difficult to do it within the current Handlebars framework. As a result, I planned a new proposal to use a React Framework in which I would be able to autogenerate different UI using content from the JSON files.\n        </p>\n        <h2>i18next Integration</h2>\n        <p>\n        Figuring out how to integrate i18next into the React framework was one of the biggest challenges I faced. It took three days of rereading the same docs over and over again, and I still could not figure out how translations worked with nested JSON arrays. After stumbling onto a GitHub thread from a couple of years ago I was finally able to figure out the syntax.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Because of the problems I had with figuring out the previous tech stack of the website and with creating the new one, as part of my project I wrote up brief <a href=\"https://github.com/connieliu0/p5.js-showcase/blob/master/showcase2020_documentation.md\">documentation</a> about how i18next worked with the JSON files.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Designing the Data Visualizations</h2>\n        <p>\n        Another challenge was figuring out what data visualizations I wanted in the beginning. In my original iteration, I focused on splitting it up into three different categories. However, that ruined the linear narrative flow and all the different visualizations felt very separate from one another. At one point, I just had a series of graphs that were auto-generated by the Google Form. I also had planned to use d3.js but my mentors encouraged me to change my approach to different JS libraries that were more tailored towards the graph types I was planning for.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"p5/data1.png\" img alt=\"dataviz\"/>\n        <p>The one advice my mentor told me that really stuck with me was to design the visualizations for a story. In my final iteration, I made sure that the visualizations acted as part of a narrative, and incorporated it with a sentence that explained the significance of the visuals.</p>\n        <img src=\"p5/data2.png\" img alt=\"dataviz2\"/>\n        <h2>Designing the Gallery</h2>\n        <p>\n        In my initial iteration of the gallery I initially thought about separating the works by topic as seen below.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"p5/galleryold.png\" img alt=\"gallery\"/>\n    <p>\n        However I soon realized that it was better to show the users upfront what they could filter through. Because there were so many different works in the end- the filter worked much better than a static page. Below is the final gallery.\n    </p>\n        <img src=\"p5/gallerynew.png\" img alt=\"gallery\"/>\n        <h2>Organizing the Submissions</h2>\n        <p>\n        Another thing that changed this year was that I reached out to many different institutions and people to try and increase the number of submissions. As a result, the showcase grew to 60 submissions! In order to make it easier for people to find what they were interested in among all the submissions, I split them up into 11 different categories. I also put tags on the bottom of each entry to give more context to the technologies used.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        In order to get more people to submit and also check out the showcase, I created some marketing graphics. It was a challenge for me, as someone who hadn’t created graphic designs in a while, but it was worth it and I learned a lot.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"p5/market.png\" img alt=\"gallery\"/>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Added translation support and implemented translations for Spanish and Chinese</li>\n            <li>Implemented data visualizations with Leaflet.js, p5.js, and Chart.js</li>\n            <li>Added filters for various project categories</li>\n            <li>Added tool tags for various niche libraries and functions used in p5.js</li>\n            <li>Created documentation for translation contributions</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Future</h2>\n        <p>Currently, I am the maintainer of the p5.js 2020 showcase repo and it exists within my GitHub account. The hope is that next summer’s GSoC student can take over as the maintainer, or work to expand the showcase into an official system that can be maintained by a team of people. Another goal is to make sure that the showcase is accessible to everyone as there wasn’t enough time to make sure it complied with a11y guidelines.</p>\n        <p>I hope that the showcase can be expanded every year or two years as a celebration of people’s work. I truly believe it’s a unique opportunity to bring the p5.js community together to recognize everyone's work.</p>\n       <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n       <p>Furthermore, I’d like to extend my deepest thanks to my mentors, Joey Lee and Yining Shi for helping me throughout the whole process and providing advice for everything from curation to career.

Hayes, Pell v. Procunier, and Saxby v. Washington Post Co.) make it difficult for journalists to access these prisons.</p>\n<p>Currently CANY is the only organization with access to that data. CANY wants to surface the data and use it to form an argument as to why its important to increase transparency about conditions inside prisons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h2>\n<p>Through a dynamic data visualization platform, CANY will able to create graphs that use real-time prison complaint data.</p>\n<ReactPlayer url=\"https://youtu.be/Vwp6bs0hroM\"/>\n<h2 id=\"competitive-analysis\">Competitive Analysis</h2>\n<p>First we did market research on similar platforms that involved editing custom visuals. What I noticed from each of these is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not all options are immediately available, and options are broken off by <strong>distinct aspects</strong> of the graph, artboard, or use-case</li>\n<li>Shifting from action to action should require a <strong>one click</strong> transition</li>\n<li>Most of the detailed options are concentrated on the <strong>sidebar</strong> and rarely on the top bar</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled.png\" />\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"information-architecture\">Information Architecture</h2>\n<p>Based off of the initial prompt, we went through several rounds of the information architecture. I chose to iterate on information architecture first paired with low-fidelity sketches because I didn't want to create the mid-fidelity until all the details were concretely defined.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iteration-1\">Iteration 1</h3>\n<p>My initial mental model was that all kinds of graphs with different x and y axis's were possible.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%201.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%201.png\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%202.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%202.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>However, through talk with the client, I learned that <strong>they were mainly interested in complaints as the dependent variable.</strong></p>\n<p>From our meeting with the client we also learned they wanted features such as a way to save the graph, undo and redo, and reset.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iteration-2\">Iteration 2</h3>\n<p>In the second iteration, complaints were pre-assigned as the y axis. I had it so the user could limit the data set from both the x and y.</p>\n<p>In the next meeting with the client, we focused on asking questions to define what the client envisioned the y and x axis being, and what actions they wanted to take in customizing the data.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%203.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%203.png\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%204.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%204.png\" />\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"user-testing\">User Testing</h2>\n<p>During our next meeting we tested our prototypes with the client, two CANY employees, and two non-CANY affiliated students for both <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>visual design.</strong> As a side note, the flows below have been abridged.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visual-feedback\"><strong>Visual Feedback</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%205.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%205.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>We had an array of options visually, but settled on two final options to test because they either echoed previous design patterns (eg google sheets) or seemed the clearest based off of internal team feedback.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%206.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%206.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>✓ Nice visually and usable after users played around with controls</p>\n<p>✗ Unclear at first the correlation between tabs and sidebar content, the active color placement in visualization settings was unnoticed</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%207.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%207.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>✓ Able to quickly toggle between different actions, similar to Google Sheets UI</p>\n<p>✓ Clear relation between the settings summary, edit summary, and the task-action</p>\n<p>✗ Unclear the settings co-related to the filters above, needs to be fixed visually</p>\n<p>Ultimately, user testing revealed users preferred Option B. We decided to freshen up the UI and optimized the spacing. We also added more visual hierarchy to the sidebar.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%208.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%208.png\" />\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"function-feedback\"><strong>Function Feedback</strong></h3>\n<p>We tested for the usefulness of our product by asking people at CANY to walk us through how they would use our tool to construct visualizations they would use from day to day.</p>\n<p>We discovered that it was hard to distinguish the difference in action between defining complaints (third option) and limiting the data-set (second option). Both were limiting the data set <em>and</em> defining the x axis at the same time, but they were separated as if they were performing two separate actions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"figuring-out-the-3-core-actions\"><strong>Figuring out the 3 Core Actions</strong></h3>\n<p>After talking with the client some more to figure out the three core actions, we learned that the y axis would always be the number of complaints and that would never change. That meant the only axis to be altered would be the <strong>x axis.</strong> The client agreed they still wanted to limit the data set and change the graph type - which meant an easy fix would be to replace changing <strong>Complaint Type</strong> to <strong>Setting X Axis.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"final-iteration\">Final Iteration</h2>\n<p>The new information architecture and design reflected the changes in the three actions.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%209.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%209.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>We also realized that the user would need a way to keep track of the multiple limits placed under the 'limit data set' option which we added visually via a side bar.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%2010.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%2010.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>We also learned that dataset was <strong>incomplete</strong> and there would be entries without demographic data. We added the explanation via a popup and placed it under the 'limit data set' side bar.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%2011.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%2011.png\" />\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"design-system\">Design System</h3>\n<p>The final visual design system was heavily based off of CANY's existing brand to maintain consistency, even though it was an internal tool. That meant using brand fonts, Oswald and Helvetica, as well as brand colors.</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"CANY/Untitled%2012.png\" alt=\"CANY/Untitled%2012.png\" />\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"results\">Results</h2>\n<p>View a walkthrough the final iteration below!</p>\n<ReactPlayer url=\"https://youtu.be/Vwp6bs0hroM\"/>\n<p>At our end of semester showcase we demo'd the project to our client and we were met with positive reviews. A CANY employee expressed his gratitude and said that our tool would make the data visualization process much faster and efficient for them, and they were so excited to use it.</p>\n<p>Because the pandemic has been stressful for everyone, our team is still working on developing the tool but it will be deployed in the spring.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reflection-as-a-designer\">Reflection as a Designer</h3>\n<p>This semester was my first time designing a project with a partner for Hack4Impact (you can view my solo work <Link to=\"/habitat\">last semester here</Link>). I learned a few key lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The user knows best</strong> - initially me and my partner had disagreements on visual designs. It wasn't until we left it to the user to give feedback that we were able to make clear, informed decisions on which avenue to pursue.</li>\n<li><strong>Walk through the user journey</strong> - if we had constructed a user journey earlier we would've realized our mental model didn't line up with our client's. We did do it verbally, but a more concrete model would've been more effective.</li>\n<li><strong>Development isn't easy</strong> - a few weeks after hand off we noticed that our designs were not implemented pixel-perfectly. Figuring out the best way to communicate with developers appropriate style sheets is still in progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"reflection-as-design-lead\">Reflection as Design Lead</h3>\n<p>This semester it was also my first time as design lead for Hack4Impact! Last semester I was the only designer, and we had grown to be 4 designers strong. It was a challenge at first leading design crits, but I soon found it to be the favorite part of my week. We had never met each other in person, but by the end of the semester I had received positive reviews that I was able to foster a supportive, uplifting environment.</p>\n        <h2>Bonus</h2>\n        <p>I also do marketing for Hack4Impact, and recently did a revamp of the brand.
