It takes first hand accounts of life from users after natural disasters and analyzes them for negative sentiment which it presents as a percentage. <strong>A functional version of the app can be seen <a href= \"https://bigredhacks40677.appspot.com\">here</a></strong></p>\n        <p>I worked on this project with two other talented freshmen: <strong>Jonna Chen</strong> who did the front-end and <strong>Angelina Saililing</strong> who did the back-end.</p>\n        <h2>The Problem</h2>\n        <p>Under the umbrella theme of <strong>natural disasters</strong>, we decided to focus on the long term mental health of a community after a natural disaster. Oftentimes, apps and relief efforts are focused on the immediate impact and there is little information on the community years after.</p>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How do we look over multiple communities years after a disaster?</li>\n          <li>How do we make sure implementation efforts are successful?</li>\n          <li>How do we understand numerous individual feedback messages?</li>\n          <li>How do we accomodate the needs of both <strong>users</strong>, the government and survivors?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>My Role</h2>\n        <p>During our process I was tasked with developing a friendly user interface and color scheme to make our user (survivors) feel at ease with 1) contributing stories and bringing up past trauma and 2) understanding the stories of others.</p>\n        <div className=\"center\">\n          <img src=\"aux1.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n          <img src=\"aux2.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>I created a mascot, a koala in a construction hat to give off a vibe of optimism and rebuilding. The color scheme of light browns and mint greens represent a natural color scheme with the green representing rejuvenation. Besides wireframing and illustration I also worked with the team on brainstorming the idea and assisted with HTML/CSS.</p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <p>Ultimately we decided on using sentiment analysis to characterize large sets of written personal accounts for various different natural disasters. In our final product, the first page focused on explaining the product. Then the official first page is focused on user (survivors) input, because the primary objective is to collect data for sentiment analysis. Because the survivor’s well-being is a focus as well we included access to mental health and support sources. The next page in the flow is the overall sentiment analysis so there is transparency about the purpose of collecting the responses. The sentiment analysis page is mostly for governmental organizations to see.</p>\n        <div className=\"center\">\n          <img src=\"aux3.1.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>We have also added a page about what others have said so the survivor can feel a sense of solidarity (the stock responses are not authentic responses and just to test to see if the sentiment analysis worked). An about page was added for context about the project.</p>\n        <div className=\"center\">\n          <img src=\"aux3.2.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Reflection</h2>\n        <p>If we had more time our team would focus on creating a long-term analytics portion of the website. That way the charity or governmental organization could have a comprehensive view to see if their efforts have paid off or not truly in the long-term rather than a single point in time.</p>\n        <p>A general note on the <strong>users</strong> of the product, since it includes both survivors and governmental organizations/charities, we designed with considerations of both in mind. We were particularly wary about the mental health of the survivors and in future iterations of the product would communicate with real users (survivors) to see if we handled collecting information deliberately enough.</p>\n        <p>Overall, it was my first time ever-making a web app with a team (shoutout to my teammates they were absolutely amazing) and I learned a lot on the way beyond making our product from IBM Watson to the Agile framework.

How do we make it easier for users to choose what kind of accounts they want to see given Instagram’s large and diverse user base.</p>\n      <h2>Target Audience</h2>\n        <p>I utilized user interviews with frequent Instagrammers (high schoolers to college students) about: </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How often they used stories</li>\n          <li>Why they used it as much as they did</li>\n          <li>What would incentivize them to use it more</li>\n          <li>Differences to snapchat stories</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In addition to in person interviews, I made a form to gather more data from different groups of users. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYBAo1ZWGLeSHhnl50lnWReJhn8CCACgwpxTFe9AssA/edit?usp=sharing\">Click here to view results and analysis from that form!</a></p>\n      <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>In order to organize my key findings, I used an affinity diagram to sort the information from user interviews.</p>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igfindings.png\" img alt=\"compiled findings\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Personas</h2>\n     <div className=\"center\">\n       <img src=\"igpersonas.png\" img alt=\"user profiles\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Narrowing the Problem</h2>\n    <p>Based off of my key findings and the needs of my personas I decided on a new problem statement.</p>\n    <p>People want to use stories about people they care about but they can’t because:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Instagram’s algorithm is based off of what they click on the most</li>\n      <li>Other accounts get buried as a result</li>\n      <li>Users don’t have time to scroll through all their stories</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Through my research, users indicated that they cared most about <strong>their close friends</strong> and having more <strong>ease</strong> in navigating what stories were available for viewing.</p>\n    <p>After brainstorming, I decided on the solution space which was separating stories based off of <strong>account types</strong>. Examples of these types would be: \"personal, business, art, writing, music\". Additionally Instagram's close friends functionality would serve as another account type.</p>\n    <p>In fact Instagram already has a functionality for this, by asking businesses to fit themselves under categories as seen by the screenshot below.</p>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igcategories.png\" img alt=\"igcategories\"/>\n   </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>I created three low to mid fidelity mock ups of the solution space.</p>\n    <h2>Idea 1: List Mode</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"1.jpg\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Pros</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Allows user to see all different account types at once</li>\n        <li>Medium feasibility- have to construct different screens</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Cons</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have to tap multiple times to get to see the list of all the stories</li>\n        <li>Medium-low impact- does not take into account what the user wants to see the most</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid1.png\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 2: Expand and Collapse</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"2.jpg\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Automatically opens to close friend’s stories, the ones the user will care about most</li>\n          <li>Allows for exploration of other type of accounts at the same time</li>\n          <li>High impact and high feasibility</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can’t see all different kinds of accounts at once</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid2.png\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 3: Tap and Drag</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"3.jpg\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can see all different account types at once</li>\n          <li>Simple drag down to view all stories at once, or one account type at a time</li>\n          <li>Medium impact- lets user explore easily</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Still can’t see stories immediately after opening the app, have to click or drag to get to stories</li>\n          <li>Medium-low feasibility- markably different from the current Instagram stories layout</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid3.png\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Exploring Expand n Collapse</h2>\n    <p>I chose this option because it allows:</p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Users to preview stories automatically from the beginning.

I wondered why people didn’t make more sustainable decisions such as using reusable materials, especially since it would only cause a minor inconvenience.</p>\n      <p><strong>Questions</strong> I asked: Why don’t people take more sustainable steps in their lives?

I was provided with a couple documents that contained an overview of the Bill and I organized the most important/relevant information into a document.

Currently there are some features to improve accessibility, for one the header of each section is left aligned and the same font/size so the reader knows where to expect each part. Also, if I could revamp this infographic, I would definitely add bolded text to large blocks of text (since the flyer is very word heavy).</li>\n       <li><strong>Compartmentalize information even further:</strong> For the Purpose section I would split the purposes into the topics that talk about reducing and eliminating and topics that talk about building and growing and add subheadings.</li>\n       </ul>\n      <p>For my second formal attempt with Adobe Illustrator I'd say I learned a lot and putting together informational graphics is easier said than done!
