It takes first hand accounts of life from users after natural disasters and analyzes them for negative sentiment which it presents as a percentage. <strong>A functional version of the app can be seen <a href= \"https://bigredhacks40677.appspot.com\">here</a></strong></p>\n        <h2>The Team</h2>\n        <p>I worked on this project with two other talented freshmen: <strong>Jonna Chen</strong> who did the front-end and <strong>Angelina Saililing</strong> who did the back-end. My job on the team was assisting a little bit with the HTML/CSS but majorly with creating the illustrations for the app, figuring out functionalities of the product with the group, and creating a prototype with Adobe XD.</p>\n        <h2>Ideation</h2>\n        <p>On developing our idea under the umbrella theme of <strong>natural disasters</strong>, our team did five minute idea sprints where we iterated solutions to various kinds of problems related to the theme. Afterwards, we pitched our ideas to each other (the ideas ranged from a resource sharing app for survivors to a survivor finding app) and then circled ones that had potential. The ones that had potential we refined and did research on how we could feasibly implement the technology required in the hackathon (which was to use Google Cloud and IBM Watson).</p>\n        <h2>The Problem</h2>\n        <p>We eventually decided to focus on the mental health of survivors and the long term survival of a community after a natural disaster. Oftentimes, apps and relief efforts are focused on the immediate impact and there is little information on the community years after.</p>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation: How do we look over multiple communities years after a disaster? How do we make sure implementation efforts are successful? How do we understand numerous individual feedback messages? How do we accomodate the needs of both <strong>users</strong>, the government and survivors?</p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <p>Ultimately we decided on using sentiment analysis to characterize large sets of written personal accounts for various different natural disasters. In our final product, the first page focused on explaining the product (there is a slight error it should generalize to natural disasters not earthquakes). Then the official first page is focused on user (survivors) input, because the primary objective is to collect data for sentiment analysis. Because the survivor’s well-being is a focus as well we included access to mental health and support sources. The next page in the flow is the overall sentiment analysis so there is transparency about the purpose of collecting the responses. The sentiment analysis page is mostly for governmental organizations to see.</p>\n        <p>We have also added a page about what others have said so the survivor can feel a sense of solidarity (the stock responses are not authentic responses and just to test to see if the sentiment analysis worked). Finally there is an about page for context on the product.</p>\n        <div className=\"center\">\n          <img src=\"aux3.png\" img alt=\"design sketches\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h2>My Role</h2>\n        <p>During our process I was tasked with developing a friendly user interface and color scheme to make our user (survivors) feel at ease with 1) contributing stories and bringing up past trauma and 2) understanding the stories of others. To do so I created a mascot, a koala in a construction hat to give off a vibe of optimism and rebuilding. The color scheme of light browns and mint greens represent a natural color scheme with the green representing rejuvenation.</p>\n        <p>Below are some screenshots of mascot sketches and Adobe XD prototyping:</p>\n        <div className=\"center\">\n          <img src=\"aux1.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n          <img src=\"aux2.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Reflection</h2>\n        <p>If we had more time our team would focus on creating a long-term analytics portion of the website. That way the charity or governmental organization could have a comprehensive view to see if their efforts have paid off or not truly in the long-term rather than a single point in time.</p>\n        <p>A general note on the <strong>users</strong> of the product, since it includes both survivors and governmental organizations/charities, we designed with considerations of both in mind. We were particularly wary about the mental health of the survivors and in future iterations of the product would communicate with real users (survivors) to see if we handled collecting information deliberately enough.</p>\n        <p>Overall, it was my first time ever-making a web app with a team (shoutout to my teammates they were absolutely amazing) and I learned a lot on the way beyond making our product. During the Hackathon I also learned about Agile framework from a Bloomberg event and about emerging technologies such as IBM Watson and Google Cloud. More importantly, turns out you can get enough sleep at a Hackathon and make a product at the same time!</p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Auxilio;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./ProjHead.js\";\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player'\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction Code(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <ProjHead\n        title=\"Various Digital Media\"\n        details= \"Just for Fun | 2019 | p5.js/Unity/Adobe Flash\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"inline\">\n      <p>Below is a video demonstrating a project I made based off of the Unity Roll a Ball tutorial (figures modeled by me in Blender) some p5.js experiments, and some Flash animations. <a href=\"https://editor.p5js.org/connieliu/sketches/rJVVfTjhQ\">Link to \"wave effect\" p5.js project</a></p>\n      <ReactPlayer url= \"https://youtu.be/9YH1rhhUjkY\" playing/>\n      </div>\n      <ProjHead\n        title=\"Design Science Prototype\"\n        details= \"Design Science | 2019 | Adobe XD\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"inline\">\n      <p>Below is the app prototype I made while at Design Science</p>\n      <ReactPlayer url= \"https://youtu.be/yytxomC_kBg\" playing/>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Code;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./ProjHead.js\";\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player';\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction UXCase(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n      <ProjHead\n        title=\"Instagram Stories Redesign\"\n        details=\"UX Mini Case Study | Winter 2019 | Figma\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <h2>Preface</h2>\n        <p>I wanted to get my feet wet with UX during my winter break, refine my skills with prototyping tools and start thinking from the view of the user! This is inspired by the processes of many, many other case studies I've seen by talented designers.</p>\n      <h2>Problem</h2>\n        <p>Instagram Stories is a new feature shipped in 2018 similar to Snapchat stories. However, it hasn’t risen to the kind of spontaneity of Snapchat stories, or usage, at least among close friends. Additionally, Instagram stories have another layer added to them, because people are following up to four hundred to six hundred other users, compared to Snapchat where people typically follow up to one hundred, there is a lot of excess stories from people users don’t care about. </p>\n        <p>There is also the added difficulty of different kinds of users, from celebrities to artists to influencers to close friends to family members. Although the algorithm currently figures out which profiles you will click on the most, what if it’s wrong? How do we make it easier for users to choose what kind of accounts they want to see?</p>\n      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>\n        <p>Instagram stories isn’t utilized as heavily as SnapChat stories because the content is not categorized so there is too much content for the user to filter through.</p>\n      <h2>Objectives</h2>\n        <p>Understand the different “categories” of people users follow, understand what content users would care about to click on a story for, create a system that would encourage using stories in a productive manner.</p>\n      <h2>Target Audience</h2>\n        <p>Instagrammers, like any social media trend, is populated by a generation, in which this case is majorly those in their early twenties, high schoolers, and middle schoolers.</p>\n        <p>I utilized user interviews with frequent instagrammers about how often they used stories, why they used it as much as they did, what would incentivize them to use it more, and differences to snapchat stories. In addition to in person interviews, I made a form to gather more data from different groups of users.</p>\n      <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>In order to organize my key findings, I used an affinity diagram and post it notes writing down the feedback I had gathered.</p>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"affinity.jpg\" img alt=\"post it note brainstorming\"/>\n        <img src=\"instafindings.png\" img alt=\"findings after user interviews\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Personas</h2>\n     <div className=\"center\">\n       <img src=\"instapersonas.png\" img alt=\"findings after user interviews\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>Based off of my keyfindings and the needs of my personas, I created three low fidelity mock ups of potential solutions. The particular problem I sought to solve was how to separate stories based off of account \"types\". By account \"types\" some examples would be categorizing your account as the following: \"personal, business, art, writing, music\". Additionally Instagram's close friends functionality would serve as another account type.</p>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"1.png\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n        <img src=\"2.png\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n        <img src=\"3.png\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Exploring Expand n Collapse</h2>\n    <p>I chose to make a high fidelity prototype for the main reason that it combines the functionalities of having stories ready to preview automatically from the beginning, as well as allowing the user to easily explore other account types. Being able to preview any stories of close friends from the getgo is important because it'll encourage the user to explore stories rather than to ignore the function entirely.</p>\n    <p>In my process I went through two iterations, below is the first</p>\n    <div className=\"center1\">\n        <img src=\"iteration1.gif\" img alt=\"first iteration with figma\"/>\n    </div>\n    <p>Although the first iteration was similar to insta's current layout, I decided that there would be accessibility issues with this option as the category button hidden behind the main one made it hard to spot and click on.</p>\n    <p>Below is the second iteration I decided on, which both allows the user to see their close friend's stories right away and also makes it easy to explore other account types.</p>\n    <ReactPlayer url= \"https://youtu.be/KaSkzdl6UIk\" playing/>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>To conclude, learning the ropes of Figma was significantly easier with my previous experience with Adobe XD (there are a lot of features that overlap). In the future I plan on developing this case study to change the way how Instagram is wired- to be more specific, making it easier to identify close friends and how stories could play into discovering niche communities. I also plan to understand how to use Sketch.

Is there a way to encourage more sustainable behavior? </p>\n      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>\n      <p>People don’t partake in sustainable actions because they don’t see any tangible impact from it, and it’s hard to change from a daily routine if there is no incentive.</p>\n      <h2>User Testing</h2>\n      <p>The users I interviewed were primarily adults and teenagers as they were the demographic most likely to use a mobile app. Questions I asked users were: Why do you find it difficult to implement sustainable habits? What are some ways you remember to do daily tasks? What would incentivize you to be more sustainable?</p>\n      <h2>Personas and Key Findings</h2>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"personas.png\" img alt=\"user personas\"/>\n        <img src=\"interview.png\" img alt=\"user interview\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Content</h2>\n     <p>Since there were many different directions to go with a general sustainability app, I decided on a model that would address some of my findings. The specific mechanics of the app would go like this: the user would schedule daily routine tasks such as \"bring reusable bag for work\". For every task they complete for the day, they grow a plant and earn coins to buy special edition plants. Each plant has a special environmental fact related to it. To also help with motivation, there is a trend page to account for the user's progress and to provide a measure of how the user's habits would build up to substantial impacts over time. To allow the user to explore sustainability in their neighborhood, there is a map function to specifically display sustainable venues. Below is the information architecture for the app features</p>\n     <div className=\"center\">\n       <img src=\"infoarch.png\" img alt=\"information architecture\"/>\n    </div>\n     <p>For my final draft I first sketched a mockup with traditional materials and then finalized it in Photoshop.</p>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"wireframedraft.jpg\" img alt=\"wireframe draft\"/>\n        <img src=\"Sus.png\" img alt=\"final wireframe\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Future and Reflection</h2>\n     <p>I created this back when I did not own Sketch but if I could do it over again I would create an interactive prototype and conduct user testing to see if the concept actually worked. I would also explore different options for the mockup instead of one. I think some interesting directions would be to explore a more concrete way for users to earn money by logging in their recycling (perhaps create a partnership with a recycling service and earn ten cents for every clean usable bale). Also to provide statistical metrics in the trends page, such as “you have saved this many watts of energy this week”. In this iteration I focused entirely on the concept of being \"rewarded\" for not breaking a habit for a consecutive number of days but I'm interested in formulating a more real world reward system.</p>\n     </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Sustainability;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Footer from './Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./ProjHead.js\";\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\nconst design = [\n  { original: 'pennenv01.jpg'},\n  { original: 'pennenv02.jpg'}\n];\nfunction Pennenv(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n      <ProjHead\n        title=\"PennEnvironment 100% Renewable Infographic\"\n        details=\"Infographic | Summer 2019 | Adobe Illustrator\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <h2>Overview</h2>\n      <p>Over the summer I created an infographic for PennEnvironment as a way to keep designing even though school was over and because I wanted to contribute to the environmental movement. During high school I did various forms of <a href=\"https://conliuart.wixsite.com/portfolio/art-as-service\">environmental activism</a> with the local borough but this time I wanted to use my skills for a professional nonprofit organization.</p>\n      <h2>Process</h2>\n       <p>At the beginning of the project I first went to the PennEnvironment office to discuss what content they wanted in the infographic. I was provided with a couple documents that contained an overview of the Bill and I organized the most important/relevant information into a document. Then, I drafted what the infographic would look like through a sketch. I then sent that to the outreach director and received feedback on the design and content. I also drafted the colors in a low fidelity mockup. Below is the first iteration:</p>\n       </div>\n       <div className=\"center\">\n         <img src=\"penn1.png\" img alt=\"design sketches\"/>\n         <img src=\"penn2.png\" img alt=\"color mockup\"/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <p>Based off of the feedback, I was given two major suggestions- one to include more PennEnvironment colors (add blues), to change certain informational parts and to improve on categorizing information by providing clear distinguishable markers in content through color and shapes. Below is the final iteration:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <ImageGallery items={design} />\n     </div>\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <h2>Reflection</h2>\n      <p>In the future, to make my final graphic more accessible, I would experiment more with using distinct shapes and rely less on color. Currently there are some features to improve accessibility, for one the header of each section is left aligned and the same font/size so the reader knows where to expect each part. Also, if I could revamp this infographic, I would definitely add bolded text to large blocks of text (since the flyer is very word heavy). I’d also compartmentalize information even further- for example for the Purpose section I would split the purposes into the topics that talk about reducing and eliminating and topics that talk about building and growing and add subheadings.</p>\n      <p>For my second formal attempt with Adobe Illustrator I'd say I learned a lot and putting together informational graphics is easier said than done! Overall it was extremely gratifying to know that my flyer has been helpful in educating people about Pennsylvania's renewable energy efforts.</p>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Pennenv;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Projects from './Projects.js';\nimport Art from './Art.js';\nimport About from './About.js';\nimport Comics from './Comics.js';\nimport Traditional from './Traditional.js';\nimport Digital from './Digital.js';\nimport Editorial from './Editorial.js';\nimport Auxilio from './Auxilio.js';\nimport Code from './Code.js';\nimport UXCase from './UXCase.js';\nimport Visual from './Visual.js';\nimport Sustainability from './Sustainability.js';\nimport Pennenv from './Pennenv.js';\n\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <HashRouter>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n      <div className=\"header\">\n        <div className=\"navigation\">\n        <h1>Connie Liu Portfolio</h1>\n            <Link to=\"/\" className=\"item\">Projects</Link>\n            <Link to=\"/art\" className=\"item\">Art</Link>\n            <Link to=\"/about\" className=\"item\">About</Link>\n            <div className=\"navigation-sub\">\n          </div>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Projects} />\n          <Route path=\"/art\" component={Art} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <Route path=\"/comics\" component={Comics} />\n        <Route path=\"/traditional\" component={Traditional} />\n        <Route path=\"/digital\" component={Digital} />\n        <Route path=\"/editorial\" component={Editorial} />\n        <Route path=\"/auxilio\" component={Auxilio} />\n        <Route path=\"/visual\" component={Visual} />\n        <Route path=\"/code\" component={Code} />\n        <Route path=\"/UXcase\" component={UXCase} />\n        <Route path=\"/sustainability\" component={Sustainability} />\n        <Route path=\"/pennenv\" component={Pennenv} />\n\n      </div>\n    </HashRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
