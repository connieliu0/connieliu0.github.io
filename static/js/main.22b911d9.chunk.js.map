It takes first hand accounts of life from users after natural disasters and analyzes them for negative sentiment which it presents as a percentage. <strong>A functional version of the app can be seen <a href= \"https://bigredhacks40677.appspot.com\">here</a></strong></p>\n        <h4>Researching the Problem</h4>\n        <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>\n        <p>Under the umbrella theme of <strong>natural disasters</strong>, we decided to focus on the long term mental health of a community after a natural disaster. Oftentimes, apps and relief efforts are focused on the immediate impact and there is little information on the community years after.</p>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How do we look over multiple communities years after a disaster?</li>\n          <li>How do we make sure implementation efforts are successful?</li>\n          <li>How do we understand numerous individual feedback messages?</li>\n          <li>How do we accomodate the needs of both <strong>users</strong>, the government and survivors?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h4>My Role</h4>\n        <h2>Illustrating and Designing</h2>\n        <p>During our process I was tasked with developing a friendly user interface and color scheme to make our user (survivors) feel at ease with 1) contributing stories and bringing up past trauma and 2) understanding the stories of others.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux1.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n          <img src=\"aux2.png\" img alt=\"wireframe\"/>\n        <p>I created a mascot, a koala in a construction hat to give off a vibe of optimism and rebuilding. The color scheme of light browns and mint greens represent a natural color scheme with the green representing rejuvenation. Besides wireframing and illustration I also worked with the team on brainstorming the idea and assisted with HTML/CSS.</p>\n        <h2 className=\"forty\">Final Product</h2>\n        <p>Ultimately we decided on using sentiment analysis to characterize large sets of written personal accounts for various different natural disasters. In our final product, the first page focused on explaining the product. Then the official first page is focused on user (survivors) input, because the primary objective is to collect data for sentiment analysis. Because the survivor’s well-being is a focus as well we included access to mental health and support sources. The next page in the flow is the overall sentiment analysis so there is transparency about the purpose of collecting the responses. The sentiment analysis page is mostly for governmental organizations to see.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux3.1.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        <p>We have also added a page about what others have said so the survivor can feel a sense of solidarity (the stock responses are not authentic responses and just to test to see if the sentiment analysis worked). An about page was added for context about the project.</p>\n          <img src=\"aux3.2.png\" img alt=\"finalproduct\"/>\n        <h2 className=\"forty\">Reflection</h2>\n        <p>If we had more time our team would focus on creating a long-term analytics portion of the website. That way the charity or governmental organization could have a comprehensive view to see if their efforts have paid off or not truly in the long-term rather than a single point in time.</p>\n        <p>A general note on the <strong>users</strong> of the product, since it includes both survivors and governmental organizations/charities, we designed with considerations of both in mind. We were particularly wary about the mental health of the survivors and in future iterations of the product would communicate with real users (survivors) to see if we handled collecting information deliberately enough.</p>\n        <p>Overall, it was my first time ever-making a web app with a team (shoutout to my teammates they were absolutely amazing) and I learned a lot on the way beyond making our product from IBM Watson to the Agile framework.

However the difference between the two is that Instagram has a wide variety of users, from celebrities to artists to influencers to close friends to family members.</p>\n        <p><strong>Primary Objective:</strong> Understand the pain points users have when navigating stories. How do we make it easier for users to choose what kind of accounts they want to see given Instagram’s large and diverse user base.</p>\n      <h2>Target Audience</h2>\n        <p>I utilized user interviews with frequent Instagrammers (high schoolers to college students) about: </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How often they used stories</li>\n          <li>Why they used it as much as they did</li>\n          <li>What would incentivize them to use it more</li>\n          <li>Differences to snapchat stories</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In addition to in person interviews, I made a form to gather more data from different groups of users. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYBAo1ZWGLeSHhnl50lnWReJhn8CCACgwpxTFe9AssA/edit?usp=sharing\">Click here to view results and analysis from that form!</a></p>\n      <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>In order to organize my key findings, I used an affinity diagram to sort the information from user interviews.</p>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igfindings.png\" img alt=\"compiled findings\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h2>Personas</h2>\n     <div className=\"center\">\n       <img src=\"igpersonas.png\" img alt=\"user profiles\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Narrowing the Problem</h2>\n    <p>Based off of my key findings and the needs of my personas I decided on a new problem statement.</p>\n    <p>People want to use stories about people they care about but they can’t because:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Instagram’s algorithm is based off of what they click on the most</li>\n      <li>Other accounts get buried as a result</li>\n      <li>Users don’t have time to scroll through all their stories</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Through my research, users indicated that they cared most about <strong>their close friends</strong> and having more <strong>ease</strong> in navigating what stories were available for viewing.</p>\n    <p>After brainstorming, I decided on the solution space which was separating stories based off of <strong>account types</strong>. Examples of these types would be: \"personal, business, art, writing, music\". Additionally Instagram's close friends functionality would serve as another account type.</p>\n    <p>In fact Instagram already has a functionality for this, by asking businesses to fit themselves under categories as seen by the screenshot below.</p>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"igcategories.png\" img alt=\"igcategories\"/>\n   </div>\n    <h2>Ideation</h2>\n    <p>I created three low to mid fidelity mock ups of the solution space.</p>\n    <h2>Idea 1: List Mode</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"1.jpg\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Pros</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Allows user to see all different account types at once</li>\n        <li>Medium feasibility- have to construct different screens</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col\">\n      <h2>Cons</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have to tap multiple times to get to see the list of all the stories</li>\n        <li>Medium-low impact- does not take into account what the user wants to see the most</li>\n      </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid1.png\" img alt=\"first ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 2: Expand and Collapse</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"2.jpg\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Automatically opens to close friend’s stories, the ones the user will care about most</li>\n          <li>Allows for exploration of other type of accounts at the same time</li>\n          <li>High impact and high feasibility</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can’t see all different kinds of accounts at once</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid2.png\" img alt=\"second ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Idea 3: Tap and Drag</h2>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"3.jpg\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Pros</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Can see all different account types at once</li>\n          <li>Simple drag down to view all stories at once, or one account type at a time</li>\n          <li>Medium impact- lets user explore easily</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col\">\n        <h2>Cons</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Still can’t see stories immediately after opening the app, have to click or drag to get to stories</li>\n          <li>Medium-low feasibility- markably different from the current Instagram stories layout</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"mid3.png\" img alt=\"third ideation\"/>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Exploring Expand n Collapse</h2>\n    <p>I chose this option because it allows:</p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Users to preview stories automatically from the beginning.

All other work from color scheme, vector graphics, layout, and content writing is mine. The prompt I was given was to create a flyer for the product, which was still in its beginning stages. In order to write the content I interviewed various interns and the CEO on the various benefits of the product. This led to the change in content on the last iteration as the final feature of building safety was no longer considered a selling point for the product.</p>\n      <p>As for web design work I created high fidelity mockups for the job application and job search pages.

While desgining the graphic assets, cover, and layout I consulted with a team consisting of primarily writers with less design or art experience.

During high school I did various forms of <a href=\"https://conliuart.wixsite.com/portfolio/art-as-service\">environmental activism</a> with the local borough but this time I wanted to use my skills for a professional nonprofit organization.</p>\n      <h2 className=\"forty\">Process</h2>\n       <p>At the beginning of the project I first went to the PennEnvironment office to discuss what content they wanted in the infographic. I was provided with a couple documents that contained an overview of the Bill and I organized the most important/relevant information into a document. Then, I drafted what the infographic would look like through a sketch. I then sent that to the outreach director and received feedback on the design and content. I also drafted the colors in a low fidelity mockup. Below is the first iteration:</p>\n         <img src=\"penn1.png\" img alt=\"design sketches\"/>\n         <img src=\"penn2.png\" img alt=\"color mockup\"/>\n      <p>Based off of the feedback, I was given two major suggestions- one to include more PennEnvironment colors (add blues), to change certain informational parts and to improve on categorizing information by providing clear distinguishable markers in content through color and shapes. Below is the final iteration:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"center\">\n      <ImageGallery items={design} />\n     </div>\n      <div className=\"projmargins\">\n      <h2>Reflection</h2>\n      <p>Future Directions</p>\n       <ul>\n       <li><strong>Increase accessibility:</strong> I would experiment more with using distinct shapes and rely less on color. Currently there are some features to improve accessibility, for one the header of each section is left aligned and the same font/size so the reader knows where to expect each part. Also, if I could revamp this infographic, I would definitely add bolded text to large blocks of text (since the flyer is very word heavy).</li>\n       <li><strong>Compartmentalize information even further:</strong> For the Purpose section I would split the purposes into the topics that talk about reducing and eliminating and topics that talk about building and growing and add subheadings.</li>\n       </ul>\n      <p>For my second formal attempt with Adobe Illustrator I'd say I learned a lot and putting together informational graphics is easier said than done! Overall it was extremely gratifying to know that my flyer has been helpful in educating people about Pennsylvania's renewable energy efforts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Visual;\n","import './App.css';\nimport Footer from './functions/Footer.js';\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Bottom from './functions/Bottom.js';\n\nfunction Habitat(props) {\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ProjHead\n            title=\"Habitat for Humanity\"\n            description=\"streamlining volunteer signups through a volunteer portal\"\n            image=\"habitat/habitat.png\"\n            timeline=\"Spring 2020, 6 weeks with Cornell Hack4Impact\"\n            role=\"With\"\n            team=\"2 Project Managers, 4 Engineers\"\n            tools=\"Figma, HTMl/CSS\"\n          />\n   <div className=\"projmargins\">\n        <div className=\"forty\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n        <p>Habitat for Humanity Tompkins County is a non-profit group in the Ithaca Area that builds homes for those in need. As part of Cornell's Hack4Impact chapter I was in charge of scoping out the details and designing a volunteer portal to streamline the process. At this point in time I was the club's <em>sole designer</em>.\n        </p>\n        <h2>The Problem</h2>\n        <p>Currently the Habitat for Humanity Tompkins County chapter streamlines the volunteer sign up process through email and an excel document which can lead to many errors. We were tasked to create a portal for volunteers to sign up for shifts and to upload forms to help make the process easier and reduce the amount of work needed by the one volunteer administrator.</p>\n        <h2>Process</h2>\n        <p>I started off with determining product specs through a call with the client. Based off the first call I made a series of low-fi sketches.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/lofis.png\" img alt=\"lofis\"/>\n        <p>The low fidelities revealed many product specs that we needed to sort out with the client, such as the need for \"groups\" of volunteers. We recompiled a list of questions to ask at the next meeting. Then, based off of that I began to do a medium fidelity prototype</p>\n        <p>Due to time constraints, the medium-fidelity immediately turned into the high-fidelity as front-end needed to get started within the given time constraint. Because of the expedited timeline, we ended up having to accomodate for new needs on the fly such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Integrating a general information notice sent out to volunteers onto the website</li>\n          <li>Adding log in, log out, and change password flows</li>\n          <li>Filtering and searching for events on the volunteer side</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Please contact me if you'd like to learn more about various decisions we made!</p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <p>We're currently still working on implementing the live version! However below are the wireframes I created for the product.</p>\n        <h2>Admin Flow</h2>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/nIF9eGrTjsXGsi335IxRLZ/Habitat-for-Humanity-Figma?node-id=760%3A2&viewport=460%2C367%2C0.08831579238176346&scaling=scale-down-width/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong> or follow along below.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/admin3.png\" img alt=\"admin3views\"/>\n        <p>In the admin flow, we have current volunteer assignments sorted by day because there can be multiple assignments in a day. Then for adding events we made sure to have repeat weeks as many assignments are on a weekly basis. Finally we have account information for password and contact management. Although not pictured, this tab will also be for <strong>volunteers</strong> in the final project.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/adminform.png\" img alt=\"admin form view\"/>\n        <p>Because the main purpose of the liability form tracker is to know which groups haven’t completed their forms yet, we included a way to hide completed groups in the second iteration. We also allowed a way for administrators to upload forms as we learned that often volunteers will hand in their forms in person on the actual day of the event.</p>\n        <h2>Volunteer Flow</h2>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/8AgoqtIhrZosB3RQ3u4Zvd/Habitat-for-Humanity-Volunteer-Flow?node-id=1%3A244&viewport=458%2C366%2C0.06753058731555939&scaling=scale-down-width/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong> or follow along below</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/volunteershifts.png\" alt=\"shifts\"/>\n        <p>The first page of the volunteer flow is upcoming shifts, because that way they have a constant reminder of what is coming up. We also have a calendar view so they can see what they have coming up long-term. We strayed away from a daily or weekly calendar because most volunteers for Habitat for Humanity only had unique monthly appointments. For the visual design of the different blocks in the calendar, we made sure we stuck with our color system and did not rely solely on color to improve accessibility.</p>\n        <p>In our color system, a blue with white inside block meant pending assignments, crossed out text meant it was canceled, and green filled in block meant the volunteer confirmed and was going.</p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/volunteersignup.png\" alt=\"signup\"/>\n      <p>We continued this color system into signup. As you can see the green outline box was in the confirmed for upcoming shifts and the button when the user confirms. The blue outline box is there for upcoming shifts you can sign up for. </p>\n      <p>We added filtering later because volunteers would often plan for shifts months in advance, and those wouldn’t immediately show up in the beginning.</p>\n      <p>Although not detailed, we had to figure out how the group system and if individuals in the group would have to make individual accounts or be incorporated into our database. Because many of these group members would be one-time only (for example clubs and fraternities), we decided that only the group leader needed to make the account.</p>\n      <img src=\"habitat/volunteerform.png\" alt=\"volunteer form\"/>\n      <p>For the form we have two versions, individual and group to account for the two different use cases.</p>\n        <h2>Reflection</h2>\n        <p>It was my first time working on a large team and also with a client! Because Hack4Impact Cornell is still a young and growing club on campus, I took a cross-discplinary role and even held a workshop for front-end on best HTML and CSS practices. Moving to remote teamwork halfway through the semester became a challenge, but I realized a huge part of success is overcommunication and always checking in with your teammates. </p>\n        <img src=\"habitat/image.png\" img alt=\"habitat pic\"/>\n        <h2>Future</h2>\n        <p>Because a major hurdle was not having design integrated into the timeline, I was unable to spend as much time on user research, prototyping, and usability testing as I would have liked. I was unable to support decisions off of user research, and much of the design thinking was lost due to time constraints.</p>\n        <p>Currently I'm serving as <strong>National Director of Design</strong> for the overarching Hack4Impact organization to remedy this problem.

Me and my partner participated according to this <a href=\"https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cf8f4e73-3942-4298-8894-3d1effe75557#pageNum=1\">project brief</a> and ended up in <a href=\"https://assets.adobe.com/public/b7e508d5-10e4-4af1-7450-be3ced472a1d\">top 50 out of ~200 teams</a> (we were called Cornell Corns).</p>\n        <p><strong>View our live prototype <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/bf82c9a1-3633-495a-7c74-925d62caa59f-c9b3/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</strong></p>\n        <h4>The Problem</h4>\n        <h2 className=\"none\">How do we encourage seniors to participate in the gaming community, especially during a time of social distancing?</h2>\n        <p>We sought to answer a series of questions in our product creation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How do we make this app friendly and accessible to seniors?</li>\n          <li>How do we optimize the experience to recommend games that account for any problems that come with older age?</li>\n          <li>How do we take in account the social networks of seniors?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div className=\"forty\">\n        <h2>Our Solution</h2>\n        <p>We designed an app called <em>Arcade</em> which plays homage to the classic video game experiences many seniors have experienced when they were young.</p>\n        <p>In our app, seniors are able to join pre-created groups set by their family or nursing home to then set up times to play online games with each other through a Google Meet call. They’re also able to discover games that fit their liking based off of various filters that take in motor control, cognitive ability, genre, and more. We were inspired by online games in general because there are thousands that have been converted for online play that people don’t know about.</p>\n        <h2>User Research</h2>\n        <p>Because of the condensed time we weren’t able to interview anyone, so we got most of our information from the internet and my past experiences as a teacher at a senior living home.</p>\n        <h2>Major Considerations</h2>\n        <h3>Visually</h3>\n        <p>Our research revealed that elderly individuals may have difficulty seeing cool colors, so we used warm colors for our app’s visual design. Additionally, we purposely leaned toward larger icons and components, visual indicators that are not color-dependent, and a minimalist style to make interactions clear and accessible, to account for those with color-blindness or poor vision. Therefore for different buttons, we tried to incorporate different non-color reliant differences such as border style and thickness even though our palette was not color-blind friendly.</p>\n        <h3>Functionally</h3>\n        <p>Originally we planned to have a traditional social media platform where anyone on the internet could connect with each other. However our research revealed that <strong>seniors preferred to limit their circle to those they already have in-person and close interaction with</strong>. We saw this app to be a tool to connect seniors with their more immediate network (ie family), and therefore focused more on joining groups based off of a code provided by the family. </p>\n        <h2>Final Product</h2>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/onboarding.png\" alt=\"onboarding\"/>\n        <p>For onboarding we decided to focus on three major limiting factors for seniors - motor control, cognitive difficulty, and other physical problems they may have to recommend games that would best fit their needs. \n</p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/schedule.png\" alt=\"scheduling\"/>\n        <p>For scheduling and viewing invites, we made sure to have large clickable buttons which are also visually different through the border style. Event discovery is simple because we restricted it to pre-organized groups because seniors prefer to have interactions with a close intimate group.\n</p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/user_communityflow.png\" alt=\"user/comm\"/>\n        <p>For the user view we allowed them to bookmark games to play later and favorite games along with standard community joining functionalities. </p>\n        <Zoom src=\"arcade/explore.png\" alt=\"explore\"/>\n        <p>For the explore page we continued with the same filtering process as onboarding. If you look at the style of each border for each filter, they correspond with the style of the button during the filtering selection.</p>\n        <h2>Results and Reflection</h2>\n        <p>We ended up scoring 77/100 which was pretty good for our first time ever participating in a design competition. I got a cumulative 12 hours of sleep that weekend, but I learned how to work with design systems on the go and with a partner remotely.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Looking back, we would’ve done more thinking to make the game to video integration process more seamless for non-technologically savvy users. Currently the flow would be to copy the game link and to paste it into the Google Meet chat, which definitely seems confusing. Also before prototyping, I would’ve definitely taken in spacing into consideration, as we were struggling to standardize it towards the end. To further improve the app, user-testing with seniors would definitely be needed as user-research relied entirely on prior experiences and online articles.\n        </p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <Footer\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default Arcade;\n","import \"./App.css\";\nimport Bottom from \"./functions/Bottom.js\";\nimport Footer from \"./functions/Footer.js\";\nimport ProjHead from \"./functions/ProjHead.js\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Zoom from \"./functions/Zoom.js\";\nimport Scrollspy from \"react-scrollspy\";\nimport { HashLink } from \"react-router-hash-link\";\n\nfunction Twitter(props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"bodytext\">\n        {/* <hr /> */}\n        <ProjHead\n          title=\"Twitter Groups Feature Concept\"\n          description=\"Prototyping a feature concept to create more personalized and distinctive spaces on Twitter\"\n          image=\"twitter/header.png\"\n          timeline=\"Spring 2020, 8 weeks\"\n          role=\"Role\"\n          team=\"Sole Product Designer\"\n          tools=\"Figma\"\n          context=\"Intro Digital Product Design Course\"\n        />\n        <div className=\"sticky\">\n          <nav className=\"section-nav\">\n            <Scrollspy\n              items={[\n                \"solution\",\n                \"userresearch\",\n                \"problemstatement\",\n                \"brainstorming\",\n                \"prototyping\",\n                \"conclusion\",\n              ]}\n              currentClassName=\"is-current\"\n            >\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#solution\">Solution Overview</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#userresearch\">User Research</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#problemstatement\">Problem Statement</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#brainstorming\">Brainstorming</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#prototyping\">Prototyping</HashLink>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <HashLink to=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</HashLink>\n              </li>\n            </Scrollspy>\n          </nav>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"projmargins\">\n          <h2>Overview</h2>\n          <p>\n            While Instagram and Facebook focus on connecting with friends, most\n            Twitter users have a mixed audience of friends, internet strangers,\n            and sometimes (especially in tech), professionals.

By taking out the explanatory\n            text, we settled on the below iteration to make it as simple as\n            possible.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2018.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Dealing with Changes in Scope:</strong> As the project\n            progressed I learned tha\n            <strong>\n              t all conditions were add/removable except for rerun interval\n            </strong>\n            .

The other was changing technical terms like &quot;active\n            hours&quot; to more understandable ones like &quot;post\n            between&quot;.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2019.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"removing\">Removing</h3>\n          <p>\n            With removal I went through a similar process, ultimately, we went\n            with inline removal as that fell inline with other add-block\n            platforms such as scratch.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2020.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"defining-the-layout-of-the-page\">\n            Defining the Layout of the Page\n          </h3>\n          <h3 id=\"f-shape-pattern\">F-Shape Pattern</h3>\n          <p>\n            The F-shape pattern indicates that people read by scanning\n            horizontally, going down, and then scanning horizontally again. I\n            experimented with having a layout in this approach below where the\n            two most editable conditions (content relevancy and posting\n            schedule) were next to each other.

With the two\n            column approach this lead to the possibility of many awkward white\n            spaces and unbalanced grids should there be missing parameters.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"separating-the-subcategories\">\n            Separating the Subcategories\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            I then experimented with a layout that gave each subcategory equal\n            weight.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2022.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Option 1 introduced scalability issue as conditions added would make\n            it more unbalanced. I leaned towards vertical scanning - having\n            every section layer on top of each other, and for conditions to fill\n            up the space horizontally. This fell more in line with{\" \"}\n            <strong>layer cake scanning</strong> - where the desired pattern\n            would be to look at the subheadings before diving into the one\n            they’re interested and scanning the details.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Visually option 3 was better than open 2 as it was easier to\n            visually distinguish the different blocks.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, the giant blocks made it unclear what was editable. Because\n            each condition was individually removable, I was inspired by scratch\n            to break it up.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2023.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2024.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"how-do-we-edit-and-add-conditions-\">\n            How do we Edit and Add conditions?\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            After finalizing on the visual layout I needed to refine the\n            micro-interactions of editing and adding.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Editing</h3>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2025.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For editing I was between several concepts that involved having a\n            locked state before an edit state. Because this added an unneeded\n            layer of complexity, as there was{\" \"}\n            <strong>no clear need for a locked preview state</strong>, I\n            ultimately went with option 4. Also because the entrypoint was an\n            edit button, the user would understand they were launching into an\n            edit state.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2026.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This decision was aided by other productivity tools which also had\n            an edit state direct on open.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"adding\">Adding</h3>\n          <p>\n            For adding I was between two concepts - one where sections and gray\n            condition blocks would show up by default, even if they had empty\n            values, and one where all conditions that were in their default\n            values were hidden. I went with hiding all conditions that had\n            default values because I didn’t want to clutter the user’s screen\n            and make them process information that had no effect on the\n            automation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2027.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I also was unsure whether to allow used to save on empty or when\n            filled. Ultimately, the design landed on allowing users to save on\n            empty or default values because it would take too much engineering\n            to ensure that users do not edit a different block and then save on\n            an empty value. Also, other platforms, such as scratch, allowed\n            users to add empty blocks as a form of scaffolding for intended\n            actions.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%2028.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One last decision item I had was whether or not to allow save on\n            empty -in the end based off of existing platforms and engineering\n            simplicity we went with option 1.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <h3 id=\"user-testing-feedback\">User Testing + Feedback</h3>\n          <p>\n            After 5 rounds of user testing I was met with a positive response!\n            The only issue was finding the entrypoint to the add flow, but once\n            users noticed the dropdown they were able to accomplish the task\n            successfully. In order to solve that - I changed the language of the\n            add entrypoint from &quot;Add&quot; to &quot;Add Condition&quot;.\n            Although a small fix, I felt like it was the one that maximized\n            efficiency and effectiveness.\n          </p>\n          <h2 id=\"metrics\">Part 2: Metrics</h2>\n          <p>\n            A major problem that we ran into was that users{\" \"}\n            <strong>did not know when or what to edit.</strong> After\n            brainstorming, I realized that optimizing consisted of two parts:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Looking in the past:</strong> To fine-tune automations,\n              users would have to look at past data to refine what previously\n              worked, or to revert to other versions.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Noticing differences:</strong> What is the current state\n              of education with automations within the social publishers?\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Line Graph</h3>\n          <p>\n            In the beginning, I thought a line graph would be perfect for\n            determining the success of automations in its trajectory throughout\n            time.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%203.png\" alt=\"Untitled\"></img>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, I realized that because users would be editing multiple\n            parameters, it made less sense to include graphs because it would be\n            harder to pinpoint what changes in metrics caused the difference.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Past History</h3>\n          <p>\n            Eventually, this evolved into the past history view - I debated it\n            having a dropdown on the same page versus on a separate tab. I went\n            with a separate tab as I scoped out user behavior - users would\n            ultimately only edit one parameter at a time so an avenue for\n            multitasking wouldn&#39;t be needed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%204.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Based off the explorations I decided to only show parameters that\n            were editable in the preview and allow users the option to view all\n            parameters if needed. One aspect I was unsure about was the utility\n            of <strong>having users toggle what was reviewable.</strong> To get\n            more feedback, I went to user testing.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%206.png\" alt=\"User Tested Prototype\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <img src=\"buzzfeed/Untitled%207.png\" alt=\"Untitled\" />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I ultimately decided on option 2 because it was more visually clear\n            that all the conditions were under the same column.

This year I\n              proposed expanding the showcase to hold more projects and allow\n              for easier searching of projects that would pique the user's\n              interest.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Users who came to the p5.js showcase website were often{\" \"}\n              <strong>novices</strong>. This meant that they wanted a site that\n              would allow them to quickly see the possibilities of the type of\n              projects they'd be looking at as well as scan the technologies\n              used. Organization was especially important as my project grew the\n              showcase ten times.\n            </p>\n            <h2>UX Redesign</h2>\n            <p>\n              The current problem with the p5.js showcase (see image below) was\n              that it was unclear what each project composed of, as the user\n              would have to read each description to determine what it was.\n              Scanning was difficult because images were of different sizes and\n              text was located at different points. With my redesign, I focused\n              on standardizing UI for easy scannability and allowing the user to\n              filter through the projects, which is important especially if they\n              already know what kind of project they're looking for.\n            </p>\n            <Zoom src=\"p5/comparison.png\" img alt=\"comparing looks\" />\n            <h2>Implementing Changes through Development</h2>\n            <p>\n              Initially, I was going to integrate the showcase into the original\n              codebase of the p5.js website. However, after a month of auditing\n              and trying different solutions (and contacting many people in the\n              community to make sense of it), I came to the conclusion that for\n              what I wanted to do- which was autogenerating 50 projects and\n              having a filter for each, it would be very difficult to do it\n              within the current Handlebars framework. As a result, I planned a\n              new proposal to use a React Framework in which I would be able to\n              autogenerate different UI using content from the JSON files.\n            </p>\n            <h2>i18next Integration</h2>\n            <p>\n              Figuring out how to integrate i18next into the React framework was\n              one of the biggest challenges I faced. It took three days of\n              rereading the same docs over and over again, and I still could not\n              figure out how translations worked with nested JSON arrays. After\n              stumbling onto a GitHub thread from a couple of years ago I was\n              finally able to figure out the syntax.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Because of the problems I had with figuring out the previous tech\n              stack of the website and with creating the new one, as part of my\n              project I wrote up brief{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://github.com/connieliu0/p5.js-showcase/blob/master/showcase2020_documentation.md\">\n                documentation\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              about how i18next worked with the JSON files.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Designing the Data Visualizations</h2>\n            <p>\n              Another challenge was figuring out what data visualizations I\n              wanted in the beginning. In my original iteration, I focused on\n              splitting it up into three different categories. However, that\n              ruined the linear narrative flow and all the different\n              visualizations felt very separate from one another. At one point,\n              I just had a series of graphs that were auto-generated by the\n              Google Form. I also had planned to use d3.js but my mentors\n              encouraged me to change my approach to different JS libraries that\n              were more tailored towards the graph types I was planning for.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/data1.png\" img alt=\"dataviz\" />\n            <p>\n              The one advice my mentor told me that really stuck with me was to\n              design the visualizations for a story. In my final iteration, I\n              made sure that the visualizations acted as part of a narrative,\n              and incorporated it with a sentence that explained the\n              significance of the visuals.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/data2.png\" img alt=\"dataviz2\" />\n            <h2>Designing the Gallery</h2>\n            <p>\n              In my initial iteration of the gallery I initially thought about\n              separating the works by topic as seen below.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/galleryold.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <p>\n              However I soon realized that it was better to show the users\n              upfront what they could filter through. Because there were so many\n              different works in the end- the filter worked much better than a\n              static page. Below is the final gallery.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/gallerynew.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <h2>Organizing the Submissions</h2>\n            <p>\n              Another thing that changed this year was that I reached out to\n              many different institutions and people to try and increase the\n              number of submissions. As a result, the showcase grew to 60\n              submissions! In order to make it easier for people to find what\n              they were interested in among all the submissions, I split them up\n              into 11 different categories. I also put tags on the bottom of\n              each entry to give more context to the technologies used.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In order to get more people to submit and also check out the\n              showcase, I created some marketing graphics. It was a challenge\n              for me, as someone who hadn’t created graphic designs in a while,\n              but it was worth it and I learned a lot.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"p5/market.png\" img alt=\"gallery\" />\n            <h2>Final Product</h2>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Added translation support and implemented translations for\n                Spanish and Chinese\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Implemented data visualizations with Leaflet.js, p5.js, and\n                Chart.js\n              </li>\n              <li>Added filters for various project categories</li>\n              <li>\n                Added tool tags for various niche libraries and functions used\n                in p5.js\n              </li>\n              <li>Created documentation for translation contributions</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h2>Future</h2>\n            <p>\n              Currently, I am the maintainer of the p5.js 2020 showcase repo and\n              it exists within my GitHub account. The hope is that next summer’s\n              GSoC student can take over as the maintainer, or work to expand\n              the showcase into an official system that can be maintained by a\n              team of people. Another goal is to make sure that the showcase is\n              accessible to everyone as there wasn’t enough time to make sure it\n              complied with a11y guidelines.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I hope that the showcase can be expanded every year or two years\n              as a celebration of people’s work. I truly believe it’s a unique\n              opportunity to bring the p5.js community together to recognize\n              everyone's work.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n            <p>\n              Furthermore, I’d like to extend my deepest thanks to my mentors,\n              Joey Lee and Yining Shi for helping me throughout the whole\n              process and providing advice for everything from curation to\n              career.
